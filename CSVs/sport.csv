68,Gokulam on the cusp of history,"Amitabha Das Sharma KOLKATA  Football in Kerala is riding the crest of fortune. After the state team won the Santosh Trophy barely a week ago, it is now the turn for Gokulam Kerala FC to take the I-League title back home and restart the celebrations.  The Malabarians have definitely held out the strong footballing tradition of the state in its performance while outgunning every opposition in the list to remain unbeaten for a record 16 matches and etch out a six-point lead on top of the current standings.  With just two rounds to go, a point from the penultimate match against Sreenidi Deccan FC on Tuesday will be enough to see Gokulam FC (on 40 points) retain the crown and become the first team in the 15-year history of the I-League to win back-to-back titles. The last team to attain something similar was the former Goa side Dempo SC but its feat is considered partial owing to a nomenclature problem.  Dempo won the National Football League in 2006-07 season and when it won the title again next season, the tournament’s name was changed to I-League.  Interestingly, the title can go Gokulam Kerala’s way even before it starts against Sreenidi Deccan, if second placed Mohammedan Sporting (on 34 points from 16) fails to win its match against Rajasthan United FC.  Gokulam Kerala coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese wished to wrap up the issue in the next outing but remained wary of the opponent which, he felt, had the knack for upstaging bigger opponents.  Tough task  “We know the importance of the game and have to put out our best to get the result in our favour. It is a tough task as the opponents always apply extra power when they are playing against the leader,” said Vincenzo Alberto. “I want my players to believe in their abilities like they have done in the previous matches.  “And if we stick to our plan then we can easily win the needed points,” he added.",Sports
69,Veteran Wawrinka rekindles fire with rare win in Rome,"AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE ROME  Swiss veteran Stan Wawrinka insisted he still has the “fire” in him after registering his first victory in over a year with a 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 win over American Reilly Opelka in the first round of the Italian Open on Monday.  The 37-year-old, who has tumbled from his best ranking of No. 3 in the world to 361st, last tasted success in the opening round of the 2021 Australian Open when he beat Marton Fucsovics in five sets.  Rough start  This year, he had previously lost in the opening rounds in the only two tournaments he had entered — Marbella and Monte Carlo — after struggling with a foot injury that has dogged him since 2019.  “After two surgeries, at my age I could easily stop playing... but I still have this fire in me,” said Wawrinka. “I still believe that I can play great tennis. I still believe that I make some big results, maybe not now, but in a few months.”  The crowd cheered warmly as the three-time Grand Slam winner completed victory over the World No. 17 Opelka, a semifinalist here last year, in just over two hours.  “It feels great because I was away from tennis for so much time,” he said. “I did a lot of hard work to come back, so it feels great to finally win a match, to see that things are getting better.”  Important results (first round):  Men: Wawrinka bt Opelka 3-6, 7-5, 6-2; Shapovalov bt Sonego 7-6(5), 3-6, 6-3.  Women: Azarenka bt Golubic 6-3, 6-0; Halep bt Cornet 6-4, 6-4; Gauff bt Kerber 6-1, 6-4.",Sports

71,Lovlina passes the Chen test,"Sports Bureau  In a repeat of her Tokyo Olympics quarterfinal bout against former World champion Nien-Chin Chen of Chinese Taipei, a confident Lovlina Borgohain recorded a narrow 3-2 win in a 70kg first round contest on the opening day of the World women’s boxing championships in Istanbul on Monday.  The Olympics bronze medallist from India executed her tactics well to emerge the winner in a tough bout featuring two 24-year-olds.  The taller Lovlina used her long reach well and moved in and out to land some solid punches on Chen and take the first round by a split verdict.  As the Taipei boxer stepped up the attack in the second round, Lovlina responded by maintaining the tempo of her game. The Indian kept herself out of Chen’s reach, battling from a safe distance and taking the upper hand in the third round.  In her first outing after the Tokyo Olympics in July last year, Lovlina — a two-time Worlds bronze medallist — met an opponent against whom she had a 1-2 head-to-head record.  Lovlina had finished with bronze medals in the 69kg weight class after losing to Chen — a World champion in 2018 and a bronze medallist in 2016 — in the semifinals of the 2018 World championships in Delhi and the 2019 Strandja Memorial event in Sofia, Bulgaria.  At the Tokyo Olympics, Lovlina beat the Taipei boxer in the quarterfinals before finishing with a bronze for reaching the semifinals. She became the second Indian woman boxer after Mary Kom, and the third overall from the country, to secure a medal at the Games.  Lovlina will meet Cindy Ngamba of Fair Chance Team (FCT) in the round-of-16 on Friday. FCT consists of sportspersons who were forced to leave their countries, often due to conflict.",Sports

76,Karthik growing in stature as the ‘Finisher’ for RCB,".K. Ajith Kumar MUMBAI  Dinesh Karthik has been very much the Finisher for Royal Challengers Bangalore at this IPL.  That is a role he has been wanting to do for Team India too. A role he has been playing to great effect for the teams he plays for.  A few months before the coronavirus pandemic broke out, one recalls watching Karthik take apart the bowlers at the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day tournament at Jaipur.  Leading the Tamil Nadu side, he chose to bat lower down the order and came up with 97 off 62 balls (against Bengal) and 65 not out off 28 balls (against Madhya Pradesh). “I want to do what M.S. Dhoni has been doing for India for many years,” he had said then.  He still has that fire in him to play for the country. “I have been trying everything to be part of the Indian team,” he had said last month after picking up the Player-of-the-Match award for his 34-ball 66 not out against Delhi Capitals at the Wankhede Stadium here.  On his return to the famed venue on Sunday, he got just eight balls to face against Sunrisers Hyderabad. He still hammered 30 not out.  That took his aggregate for the season so far to 274 runs off 137 balls, at a strike rate of 200 and an average of 68.50. He has made those runs with dazzling footwork and sublime timing.  You may not find too many better finishers in the game at the moment. Little wonder former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted, “DK has to be in the Indian T20 World Cup team.”",Sports

78,"Curry, Warriors Rally Past Grizzlies 101-98 for 3-1 Lead","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Stephen Curry converted eight free throws over the final 45.7 seconds on the way to 32 points, leading the Golden State Warriors’ fourth-quarter comeback for a 101-98 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night and a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference semifinals. Curry also dished out eight assists and grabbed five rebounds as Golden State rallied to win without coach Steve Kerr after he tested positive for COVID-19 less than two hours before tipoff.  Curry took charge just like he has so many times on the playoff stage and now his Warriors are one win from a trip to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2019. He tied it at 90 on a fall-away baseline jumper with 3:25 to go and his two free throws with 45.7 seconds to go gave the Warriors a 94-93 lead, their first of the night.  Tyus Jones had 19 points, six rebounds and five assists as Memphis missed injured All-Star Ja Morant. Dillon Brooks returned from a one-game suspension and struggled mightily, missing a 3-point try with 53 seconds left and finishing 5 for 19 with 12 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Andrew Wiggins had 17 points and 10 rebounds and Klay Thompson scored 14 points despite missing all seven of his 3-point attempts for the cold-shooting Warriors, who didn't have to contend with do-everything Morant this time. The Grizzlies guard missed the game with soreness in his right knee after Jordan Poole grabbed him while going for a loose ball late in Game 3 — leading Morant and Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins to question Poole’s intentions.  It remained unclear whether Morant would be back for Game 5 on Wednesday in Memphis.  Brooks sat out Game 3 as a penalty by the league for his Flagrant 2 foul that injured Gary Payton II in Game 2, when Brooks hit the Golden State guard over the head on a driving layup attempt and Payton fell hard and broke his left elbow. Kerr called it a “dirty” play and said Brooks had broken an NBA code of conduct.  Brooks was booed nearly every time he touched the ball, fouled or when he checked back into the game.  Golden State trailed 69-62 going into the fourth quarter after Desmond Bane's 32-foot 3-pointer beat the third-quarter buzzer. However, both teams struggled all night to make their 3s.  Kerr was replaced by associate head coach Mike Brown, who agreed Sunday to become the Sacramento Kings new coach after this postseason run.  Poole scored 14 off the bench for the Warriors as they survived a nail-biter following a postseason-record point total in Saturday's 142-112 Game 3 blowout.  CURRY'S KICKS  Curry sported special edition pair of orange Curry 9 Flow sneakers with colorful decorations to honor the late TNT broadcaster Craig Sager and his impact on the NBA.  Curry will autograph the shoes for auction on Wednesday on the NBA auction website with all proceeds going to the SagerStrong Foundation. The two-time MVP changed to lavender-colored sneakers in the second half.  TIP-INS  Grizzlies: C Steven Adams, who returned from the health and safety protocols to play six minutes in the waning moments of Saturday's blowout, started and contributed 10 points and 15 rebounds as Memphis did a better job staying with the Warriors on the boards — outrebounded 54-48. ... The Grizzlies were 9 of 35 on 3s.  Warriors: The Warriors committed 11 first-half turnovers and 16 total. ... Golden State started 0 for 15 from deep before Otto Porter Jr. connected 3:24 before halftime. Thompson missed all seven of his 3s and Curry his initial five before becoming the first player in NBA history to make 500 postseason 3-pointers when he connected 46.2 seconds before halftime. ... The Warriors were the first team to go 0 of 15 from long range to start a game since the 2011 Thunder were 0 for 16 against Dallas in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals, according to Elias. ... The Warriors had no immediate additional positive COVID tests, the team said.",Sports

82,Bumrah special not enough as Knight Riders beat Mumbai Indians,"Abhishek Mukherjee NAVI MUMBAI  Jasprit Bumrah’s fiery spell went in vain as Kolkata Knight Riders put up a disciplined effort with the ball to successfully defend 165 and register a 52-run win at the D.Y. Patil Stadium here on Monday. Pat Cummins (three for 22), Andre Russell (two for 22) and Tim Southee (one for 10) bowled probing spells and reaped rewards to keep Shreyas Iyer’s men in the hunt for the playoffs.  After being stunned by Bumrah during the business-end of their innings, Knight Riders came back strongly to chip away at the opposition.  Rohit Sharma fell in the first over, caught behind off Southee. Tilak Varma and Ramandeep Singh perished while trying ambitious shots off Andre Russell; Tim David, after a fiesty start with boundaries off the first three balls he faced, top-edged when attempting to smash Varun Chakravarthy out of the park.  Ishan Kishan (51, 43b, 5x4, 1x6), however, was in full flow at the other end. Playing the ball on its merit, he found the odd boundary through sweetly-timed drives in the ‘V’. When he, too, couldn’t resist the fatal pull shot, Knight Riders were well and truly on top. Cummins took two more in the same over, both off short deliveries. Poor running by the Mumbai Indians lower-order hastened the end.  That Mumbai Indians had a fighting chance at the halfway stage was mainly due to an excellent bowling performance from Bumrah. Unsettling the batters with yorkers and short deliveries, Bumrah claimed his maiden five-wicket haul (five for 10) in the IPL as Knight Riders lost their way after a bright start. The last six wickets fell for 28 runs. Venkatesh Iyer (43, 24b, 3x4, 4x6), returning to the side after sitting out the last two games, helped the team post its highest total in the PowerPlay this season — 64 — before Nitish Rana (43, 26b, 3x4, 4x6) took the baton from him and kept the boundaries coming.  Bumrah changed the complexion of the game in the 15th over, softening up Russell with a sharp yorker before testing him with a short delivery. Russell went for the pull but holed out to the fielder at long-on.  Rana fell in the same over, undecided whether to duck or fend a short ball and gloving the ball to the wicketkeeper. In Bumrah’s next over, Sheldon Jackson, Cummins and Sunil Narine all perished to quick deliveries. Mumbai Indians got a taste of its own medicine when it batted.",Sports

His decision making on the go has been on point so far.   And Match 51 between GT and Mumbai Indians was no different.   After MI openers Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan got the team to a quick start, Hardik was smart enough to pull things back with his tactical moves.   One of the smartest moves on the night was when Ishan Kishan fell for 45 off 29 balls.  His former MI teammate Kieron Pollard came to bat at No 5 and Hardik brought back Rashid Khan instantly.   Pollard has had issues with Rashid and it was telling again when the big West Indian began to struggle against the turn and guile of Afghan bowler.  Rashid bowled four back to back dots and then Pollard attempted to play a cover drive, but he misread the line and the ball kissed the stumps.   That was a smart move frm Hardik, who has spent many a seasons with Mumbai Indians and knows a thing of two about Pollard's batting. ",Sports

The race now is to decide the table-topper.  Desperate  Hardik Pandya’s Titans — having lost their last two games — will be desperate to get back into winning mode. K.L. Rahul’s Super Giants, on the other hand, will be hoping to extend their four-match winning streak.  While Rahul will be gunning to close in on Jos Buttler’s Orange Cap, Lucknow’s pace quartet will be eager to repeat its heroics at the same venue against Kolkata Knight Riders over the weekend.  Banking on Gill  The Titans, though, will be banking on Shubman Gill to withstand the onslaught of Mohsin Khan & Co. and the left-handed duo of David Miller and Rahul Tewatia to come to the party later on in the innings.",Sports

88,Asian Games 2022 postponed amid COVID surge in China: OCA,"TASHKENT/BEIJING: The Hangzhou Asian Games, which were scheduled to take place from September 10 to 25, were on Friday postponed indefinitely amid a recent surge in COVID-19 cases in China. The new dates will be announced in near future. An air of uncertainty was hovering over the 19th edition of the multi-sports Games ever since Shanghai came under a fresh wave of the pandemic, forcing a lockdown in the city. The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) Executive Board met in Tashkent on Friday to discuss the situation and felt postponing the Games was the best decision under the circumstances.  ""Following detailed discussions with the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) and the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee (HAGOC), the OCA Executive Board (EB) today decided to postpone the 19th Asian Games, which were scheduled to be held in Hangzhou, China, from 10 to 25 September 2022,"" the OCA said in a statement, posted on its website. ""The new dates of the 19th Asian Games will be agreed between the OCA, the COC and the HAGOC and announced in the near future,"" the statement added. The OCA said the HAGOC was well prepared to deliver the Games on time despite global challenges. However, after carefully considering the pandemic situation and the magnitude of the Games, the decision was taken by all the stakeholders. The name and the emblem of the 19th Asian Games will remain unchanged, and the OCA believes that the Games will achieve complete success through the joint efforts of all parties. About 11,000 athletes were to compete in 61 sporting disciplines in the Games. The development comes at a time when China is battling a record number of daily cases in Shanghai, which is only a short train ride away from Games host city Hangzhou. Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, is some 175 kilometres southwest of Shanghai. As per the latest update, Zhejiang has recorded 3124 positive cases and one death. Additionally, the 3rd Asian Youth Games, which was scheduled from December 20-28 in Shantou, China have also been cancelled. The next Asian Youth Games will therefore be held in 2025 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.",Sports
