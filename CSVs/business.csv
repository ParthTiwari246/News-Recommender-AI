2,Money Talks: Navigating unemployment two years into the pandemic,"n April 2020, we reached out to screenwriters Ryan and Julie (not their real names) to learn how the entertainment industry was dealing with the still-nascent pandemic. Ryan was earning $18 an hour prior to being laid off; Julie was earning $16.50 in a union-protected job. Now that Hollywood is effectively back in business, we got back in touch with Ryan and Julie, now aged 41 and 34, to learn how Covid-19 changed the industry — and how these changes have affected their lives and finances.  Ryan: I was on unemployment until October 2020, right when the end of the extra government unemployment money went away, and I got a call for a job. It timed out perfectly for me. I got hired as a showrunner’s assistant for my old boss, and I ended up being on that for a year. It was a year of income, and I ended up getting promoted to writer. I ended up getting 14 weeks of a writer’s paycheck, which was literally five times what I was making as an assistant.  Things were great for a while after that!",Business

4,NTPC invites bids to import 4.53 million tonnes of coal,"RESS TRUST OF INDIA New Delhi  State-owned power giant NTPC has invited bids to procure 4.53 million tonnes (MT) of imported coal, mainly for blending with the domestic dry fuel in thermal plants.  The tender assumes significance in view of the ongoing dry fuel shortage at power plants. Earlier this month, the Power Ministry had directed all the States and gencos to import at least 10% of their requirement of coal for blending amid shortages at thermal plants.  The tender documents showed that NTPC has floated three separate tenders for procuring 4.53 MT — 1.5 MT, 1.6MT and 1.43 MT — of imported coal on May 7, 2022.  The company had invited bids to procure 4.93 MT of imported coal last month.  It has been mandated to procure 20 MT of imported coal in 2022-23 for blending with the domestic dry fuel at its thermal plants because of the ongoing shortage.  The NTPC has invited bids for procurement of 1.43 MT of imported coal on FOR (Freight On-Road) power station basis for NTPC plants at Vindhyachal, Rihand, Singrauli, Khargone, Dadri, Tanda and Unchahar.

7,Industrial licences: Special govt. drive,"New Delhi, May 9: The Industrial Development Minister, Mr. Moinul Haq Choudhury, to-day said a special drive would be launched shortly to ensure speedy implementation of the licences issued for various industrial projects in the country. Replying to a four-hour discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the working of his Ministry, Mr. Choudhury said the proposed drive would enable the Ministry to review the licensing process systematically, to revoke licences where necessary and to assist the entrepreneurs with speedy clearance where called for. He said the drive would be conducted by a regular committee of officers. The hour-long reply of Mr. Choudhury was marked by frequent interruptions by Mr. Bhupesh Gupta (CPI) who repeatedly levelled charges against the Minister who emphatically denied them. Mr. Choudhury said the game of praising some Ministers and running down others had been going on for the past few years. This was aimed at dividing the Congressmen and they would see through it. Raising his voice, he remarked: “I am not a Minister here at the mercy of anybody.” He denied there was any proposal under consideration to bring some labour-oriented industries from abroad.

8,Why more Americans than ever are starting their own businesses,"While millions of Americans are quitting their jobs in search of better employment, many of them are doing so in the hope of never having to work for someone else ever again.  The pandemic has, at least for the time being, halted — and perhaps reversed — a decadeslong decline in the pace of entrepreneurship. Americans applied for a record 5.4 million business ID numbers in 2021, according to census data that goes back to 2004. 2022 is already on track to be a record year as well, according to projections from QuickBooks. While data on true business formations is available only through 2019, growth in ID number applications is closely related to actual business formations. Other datasets, including Bureau of Labor Statistics data that shows a rise in self-employed people as well as data from a number of companies that offer small business tools, bear out the trend toward record entrepreneurism.  The recent growth in new businesses has big implications for the Americans starting them and the people who used to employ them, as well as for the future of government policy and the resilience of the economy in general.  Part of what makes this rise of new businesses important is that it encompasses a broader segment of society than in years past. Women, Black Americans, and those without college degrees are starting a much larger share of online microbusinesses than before the pandemic, according to data from Venture Forward, a research initiative from GoDaddy, a web domain company that’s increasingly offering other small business tools. Women started 57 percent of those businesses since March 2020 compared with 48 percent before; Black Americans founded 26 percent, up from 15 percent pre-pandemic; and Americans without college degrees founded 44 percent compared with 36 percent. In 2020, the rate of women and people of all ethnicities starting businesses of all types increased sharply, according to Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship (2021 data will be out in February).",Business

10,Rupee hits a new low amid dollar outflow,"Lalatendu Mishra Mumbai  The rupee on Monday fell to an all-time low of 77.44 against the U.S. dollar due to a sell-off in equities amid concerns over weakening global growth prospects, outflow of the dollar and on fears of further monetary tightening by central banks to counter rising inflation. The previous closing low for the rupee was 77.09, seen on March 7.  “A sell-off in the global equity markets which was triggered by the hike in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the war in Europe and growth concerns in China due to the COVID-19, led to the rupee depreciation,” Emkay Global Financial Services said.",Business
11,Only 1% of women in 15-49 age group consume alcohol: NFHS-5 report,"Afshan Yasmeen Bengaluru  While it is known that alcohol consumption has always been high among men, the recently released National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) for 2019-2021 has found that only 1% of women, aged 15-49, drink alcohol in the country, compared to 22% of men. The overall consumption is high in rural areas, stated the report.  In Karnataka, 0.3% of women consume alcohol, below the national average. But 23.1%. of men do so, which is higher than the national average.  The percentage of women who consume alcohol is the highest in Arunachal Pradesh (18%), followed by Sikkim (15%). Alcohol use among men is the highest in Goa (59%), followed by Arunachal Pradesh (57%), and Telangana (50%), while it is the lowest in Lakshadweep (1%).  Among women who drink alcohol, 17% consume it almost every day and 37% drink about once a week. Among men, while 15% consume almost daily, 43% drink about once a week, and 42% do less than once a week.  Drinking alcohol is more common among women from Scheduled Tribes (4%) than from any other caste/tribe group.  Consumption is also most common among Christian men (36%) and men belonging to “other” religions (49%). The “other” religions here are those apart from the Hindu, the Muslim, the Christian, the Sikh, the Buddhist/Neo-Buddhist, and the Jain communities.  Drinking is also seen in 33% of men with less than 5 years of schooling, 34% of those from Scheduled Tribes, and 30%. of those in the age group of 35-49.  Overall the proportion of men who drink alcohol decreased from 29% to 22% between NFHS-4 in 2015-2016 and NFHS-5 in 2019-2021. During that period, the proportion of women who drink has remained unchanged, according to the report.  NIMHANS study  NIMHANS Director Pratima Murthy, who was part of a study found that excessive alcohol consumption can cause irreversible changes to the DNA and that changes may persist even when it is no longer consumed. She said the reduction in alcohol consumption as per the NFHS-5 report could also be due to the non-availability during the COVID-19 lockdown.  The study by NIMHANS, published last year in the American Journal of Medical Genetics, found that the effects of alcohol were more pronounced in those who had started at an early age.  Dr. Murthy told The Hindu that the findings suggest that starting to drink early may physically alter many genes, including those of the brain. “This may have a significant effect on brain development and maturation that may persist to the later adult life,” she said.  Vivek Benegal, Professor of Psychiatry, who heads the Centre for Addiction Medicine at NIMHANS, said that the overall reduction in consumption is a welcome change. However, it needs to be seen in the perspective of the consistent increase in sales and production of alcohol.  “The findings will have to be balanced with consistent increase in sales and production of alcohol during the period when the reduction has been observed,” Dr. Benegal said",Business

15,There’s finally momentum to stop stock trading in Congress,"Bills banning members of Congress from trading stocks are gaining increased bipartisan support — including from a former skeptic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — after a series of investigations involving potential insider trading by lawmakers, particularly in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.  There’s wide agreement among voters that legislators should be banned from trading stocks while in Congress, since their position can give them access to information about companies and industries that ordinary people don’t have. While there are some policies in place to at least provide transparency about how legislators are making money from the stock market, there aren’t significant punishments for violating those rules.  In fact, as Business Insider’s Dave Levinthal reported earlier this month, at least 55 members of Congress violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2021 alone.  The law — better known as the STOCK Act — was passed in 2012 to curtail the use of inside information to trade stocks, but many lawmakers now believe it didn’t go far enough to curb abuses.  Business Insider’s reporting, as well as the high-profile investigations of Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and former Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for suspiciously well-timed trades around the advent of the pandemic, have (somewhat belatedly) spurred new energy around legislation to prevent members of Congress from trading stocks while in office, with multiple bills introduced in the House and Senate aiming to do just that — albeit with varying degrees of stringency, and a lack of clarity regarding who exactly should be targeted.  According to Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen, public frustration with ethical issues — and widespread public support for a stock trading ban — is likely driving the current push.",Business
16,Govt. said to urge Reserve Bank to help push bond yields lower,"Reuters New Delhi  The government has asked the central bank to either buy back government bonds or conduct open market operations to cool yields that have hit their highest since 2019, as inflation risks push foreign investors to sell, a government source told Reuters on Monday.  The 10-year benchmark bond ended at 7.46%, after earlier reaching a high of 7.49%. “The discussion with the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) is at an advanced stage as current yields are not at comfortable levels,” the government official, with direct knowledge of the matter, said on condition of anonymity. The official said government expects the RBI to conduct a switch operation, offering investors a chance to exchange their short-dated bonds for debt with a longer maturity, or to buy back government bonds within the next two weeks.  The request from the government could complicate the RBI’s policy of withdrawing liquidity from the market, which marks a shift away from the ultra-loose monetary stance it took during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The RBI surprised markets last week by raising its key interest rate by 40 basis points to 4.40% to fight inflation — its first increase in nearly four years.  Foreign portfolio investors have sold $697 million of government securities since April 1 and $1.18 billion this year, traders said.  India’s forex reserves fell $2.7 billion to $597.73 billion on April 29, RBI data showed, marking the eighth straight week of declines and the first time falling below $600 billion in a year.",Business

19,Peloton’s big whoops,"Peloton is in a pickle.  In 2020, the at-home digital exercise company could not get its products out the door fast enough. It surpassed $1 billion in quarterly sales during the last three months of the year, and leadership fretted its profits could take a hit as it invested to try to keep pace with pandemic-induced Pelotonpalooza. People waited weeks and months for their bikes and treadmills to be delivered. Alongside companies such as Zoom and Clorox, Peloton’s stock was a solid stay-at-home bet on Wall Street. But nothing lasts forever.  Fast-forward to 2022, and Peloton finds itself in quite a different spot. The good news: It has caught up on the supply side and finally has bikes and treadmills readily available. The bad news: The demand it’s trying to catch up to is no longer there. CNBC’s Lauren Thomas reports that Peloton is going to hit pause on production for a while.  “Peloton has been plagued with a supply-demand mismatch since the pandemic started,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who has been bearish on the company for quite some time. “The problem has basically inverted.”  Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have found out more about the supply chain than they ever imagined. American consumers are accustomed to things just showing up at their doorsteps or on the shelves when they want, no questions asked. Everyone knows about supply and demand theoretically, but everything we’re learning about them in practice now is, to quote the meme, against our will.  The public health crisis has thrown many parts of the economy out of whack, and it’s made doing business more complicated across industry after industry. There have been plenty of well-documented kinks in the supply chain. (Who knew there’d be this surge of interest in shipping containers?) There’s been all sorts of weirdness in demand as well.

21,The case against the Supreme Court of the United States,"Two events occurred Monday night — one historic, the other rather insignificant — which placed an unflattering spotlight on the Supreme Court of the United States.  The historic event was that Politico published an unprecedented leak of a draft majority opinion, by Justice Samuel Alito, which would overrule Roe v. Wade and permit state lawmakers to ban abortion in its entirety in the US. Alito’s draft opinion is not the Court’s final word on this case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, but the leaked opinion is the latest in a long list of signs that Roe may be in its final days.  The other event that also occurred last night is that I sent two tweets. One praised whoever leaked Alito’s opinion for disrupting an institution that, as I have written about many times in many forums, including my first book, has historically been a malign force within the United States. And a second celebrated the leak for the distrust it might foster in such a malign institution.",Business

26,Have we been thinking about economic growth all wrong?,"That’s an alarming-seeming but ultimately misleading number; most of it is accounted for by changes in international trade (imports, which reduce GDP numbers, rose as businesses knew war in Ukraine was coming) and the shrinking of inventories held by businesses as consumers bought them up. “Final sales to domestic purchasers,” which strips out those factors, was up 0.6 percent for the quarter, or 2.6 percent annually.  However you parse the release, though, this seemed as good a time as any to discuss the long-run future of growth in the US and the rest of the world. I’m getting pretty worried about it, to be honest! And I’m worried because of an economics paper by NYU’s Thomas Philippon with the unassuming name “Additive Growth.”  The implication of Philippon’s paper is as simple as it is disturbing: We should expect economic growth to slow down in the long run, and the big leaps forward of the last couple centuries may be an aberration.  This conclusion is far from certain, and it goes against decades of assumptions on how to model economic growth. But Philippon brings a lot of data to bear on his thesis, which makes some intuitive sense, and even the possibility of it being true should alarm us.  The big pile of stuff we know how to do Philippon’s paper is not concerned with economic growth per se, but with a variable that is central to explaining long-run growth: total factor productivity, or TFP.  Defining or getting a handle on the idea of TFP can be tricky. Technically, it’s just a residual: the annual growth rate of TFP is what you get when you look at annual economic growth, and remove the growth attributable to an increase in labor (more hours worked) or capital accumulation (more factories built, labor-saving machines purchased, etc).",Business
27,Andaman to get gas-based power plant,"acob KoshyNew Delhi  The Union Environment Ministry has approved an exemption to the laws governing the regulation of coastal zones and has paved the way for gas-powered plants to be set up on the Andaman and Nicobar islands.  The Island Coastal Zone Regulation (ICRZ), 2019, limits infrastructure development on vulnerable coastal stretches.  Enabling provision  In the aftermath of a proposal from the Andaman and Nicobar Coastal Zone Management Authority (ANCZMA), an expert body of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, called the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA), recommended in August 2021 that it was necessary to provide an “enabling provision in the ICRZ notification” to meet the energy requirement of the islanders while reducing the dependence on highly polluting energy sources such as conventional diesel generator (DG) sets.  The NCZMA has recommended that gas-based power plants be permitted within the Island Coastal Regulation Zone area only on islands with geographical areas greater than 100 sq. km.  The Central government, following this, invited comments from the public on modifications to to the ICZR, and on May 5, issued a notification accepting the National Coastal Zone Management Authority recommendation.  The Andaman and Nicobar administration is expected to commission a 50-MW power project running on liquefied natural gas at Hope Town, Port Blair, to be developed by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).  Following visits by the NTPC personnel, a dual-fuel power plant that runs on both diesel and LNG is expected to be commissioned.  Back-up clause  Diesel is necessary, the Andaman administration authorities argued, as a back-up fuel when the region faced inclement weather.  There has been an increased interest in the development of the Andaman region following a policy push by the NITI Aayog.  A proposed project plans to develop the Greater Andaman region or the southernmost stretch of the island group.  Proposals include a 22-sq.km airport complex, a transshipment port (TSP) at South Bay at an estimated cost of ₹12,000 crore, a parallel-to-the-coast mass rapid transport system and a free trade zone and warehousing complex on the southwestern coast.",Business
28,The awful American consumer,"Some of the angriest emails I’ve ever gotten from readers were over a story about credit card points.  The long and short of it is that the fancier the credit card rewards, the higher the swipe fees for merchants. Those merchants often pass along the costs of those swipe fees to all customers, whatever the payment mechanism. People who pay with rewards cards tend to be more well-off, financially, and their hotel points or flight miles are being, in part, subsidized by people paying in cash or debit who tend to be poorer. A 2010 paper found that households that use cash pay about $149 on average to households that use credit cards, and each of the credit card households gets $1,133 from cash users every year.  Essentially, credit card rewards have to come from somewhere, and they’re partly coming from people who aren’t reaping the benefits. Some readers were very angry to discover this information. “Maybe it’s time for people who don’t want to work to know how it feels to foot the bill for other people?” one person wrote to me, apparently equating having a rewards card with having a job. “If people want a better life I suggest education and getting a degree or a certificate in a trade,” wrote another person. “Boohoohoo. Who cares?” wrote another.  Some people seemed to feel that they had a serious right to accumulate credit card rewards, regardless of who or what those rewards were coming from. It’s a sentiment that bears out in the data: A 2019 LendingTree survey found that people were likelier to support a rate cap on credit cards if it reduced access for people with imperfect credit than they were if it meant it would significantly lower their rewards.  “What that essentially says is that more people [were] okay with fewer folks having access to credit than they were with having their own credit card rewards shrink,” explained Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email.  That consumers can be selfish isn’t a new phenomenon. Remember when everyone was hoarding toilet paper and masks at the start of the pandemic? But it is worth pausing and reflecting on how angry people feel when confronted with the idea. ",Business
