2,Money Talks: Navigating unemployment two years into the pandemic,"n April 2020, we reached out to screenwriters Ryan and Julie (not their real names) to learn how the entertainment industry was dealing with the still-nascent pandemic. Ryan was earning $18 an hour prior to being laid off; Julie was earning $16.50 in a union-protected job. Now that Hollywood is effectively back in business, we got back in touch with Ryan and Julie, now aged 41 and 34, to learn how Covid-19 changed the industry — and how these changes have affected their lives and finances.  Ryan: I was on unemployment until October 2020, right when the end of the extra government unemployment money went away, and I got a call for a job. It timed out perfectly for me. I got hired as a showrunner’s assistant for my old boss, and I ended up being on that for a year. It was a year of income, and I ended up getting promoted to writer. I ended up getting 14 weeks of a writer’s paycheck, which was literally five times what I was making as an assistant.  Things were great for a while after that!",Business

4,NTPC invites bids to import 4.53 million tonnes of coal,"RESS TRUST OF INDIA New Delhi  State-owned power giant NTPC has invited bids to procure 4.53 million tonnes (MT) of imported coal, mainly for blending with the domestic dry fuel in thermal plants.  The tender assumes significance in view of the ongoing dry fuel shortage at power plants. Earlier this month, the Power Ministry had directed all the States and gencos to import at least 10% of their requirement of coal for blending amid shortages at thermal plants.  The tender documents showed that NTPC has floated three separate tenders for procuring 4.53 MT — 1.5 MT, 1.6MT and 1.43 MT — of imported coal on May 7, 2022.  The company had invited bids to procure 4.93 MT of imported coal last month.  It has been mandated to procure 20 MT of imported coal in 2022-23 for blending with the domestic dry fuel at its thermal plants because of the ongoing shortage.  The NTPC has invited bids for procurement of 1.43 MT of imported coal on FOR (Freight On-Road) power station basis for NTPC plants at Vindhyachal, Rihand, Singrauli, Khargone, Dadri, Tanda and Unchahar.

7,Industrial licences: Special govt. drive,"New Delhi, May 9: The Industrial Development Minister, Mr. Moinul Haq Choudhury, to-day said a special drive would be launched shortly to ensure speedy implementation of the licences issued for various industrial projects in the country. Replying to a four-hour discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the working of his Ministry, Mr. Choudhury said the proposed drive would enable the Ministry to review the licensing process systematically, to revoke licences where necessary and to assist the entrepreneurs with speedy clearance where called for. He said the drive would be conducted by a regular committee of officers. The hour-long reply of Mr. Choudhury was marked by frequent interruptions by Mr. Bhupesh Gupta (CPI) who repeatedly levelled charges against the Minister who emphatically denied them. Mr. Choudhury said the game of praising some Ministers and running down others had been going on for the past few years. This was aimed at dividing the Congressmen and they would see through it. Raising his voice, he remarked: “I am not a Minister here at the mercy of anybody.” He denied there was any proposal under consideration to bring some labour-oriented industries from abroad.

8,Why more Americans than ever are starting their own businesses,"While millions of Americans are quitting their jobs in search of better employment, many of them are doing so in the hope of never having to work for someone else ever again.  The pandemic has, at least for the time being, halted — and perhaps reversed — a decadeslong decline in the pace of entrepreneurship. Americans applied for a record 5.4 million business ID numbers in 2021, according to census data that goes back to 2004. 2022 is already on track to be a record year as well, according to projections from QuickBooks. While data on true business formations is available only through 2019, growth in ID number applications is closely related to actual business formations. Other datasets, including Bureau of Labor Statistics data that shows a rise in self-employed people as well as data from a number of companies that offer small business tools, bear out the trend toward record entrepreneurism.  The recent growth in new businesses has big implications for the Americans starting them and the people who used to employ them, as well as for the future of government policy and the resilience of the economy in general.  Part of what makes this rise of new businesses important is that it encompasses a broader segment of society than in years past. Women, Black Americans, and those without college degrees are starting a much larger share of online microbusinesses than before the pandemic, according to data from Venture Forward, a research initiative from GoDaddy, a web domain company that’s increasingly offering other small business tools. Women started 57 percent of those businesses since March 2020 compared with 48 percent before; Black Americans founded 26 percent, up from 15 percent pre-pandemic; and Americans without college degrees founded 44 percent compared with 36 percent. In 2020, the rate of women and people of all ethnicities starting businesses of all types increased sharply, according to Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship (2021 data will be out in February).",Business

10,Rupee hits a new low amid dollar outflow,"Lalatendu Mishra Mumbai  The rupee on Monday fell to an all-time low of 77.44 against the U.S. dollar due to a sell-off in equities amid concerns over weakening global growth prospects, outflow of the dollar and on fears of further monetary tightening by central banks to counter rising inflation. The previous closing low for the rupee was 77.09, seen on March 7.  “A sell-off in the global equity markets which was triggered by the hike in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the war in Europe and growth concerns in China due to the COVID-19, led to the rupee depreciation,” Emkay Global Financial Services said.",Business
11,Only 1% of women in 15-49 age group consume alcohol: NFHS-5 report,"Afshan Yasmeen Bengaluru  While it is known that alcohol consumption has always been high among men, the recently released National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) for 2019-2021 has found that only 1% of women, aged 15-49, drink alcohol in the country, compared to 22% of men. The overall consumption is high in rural areas, stated the report.  In Karnataka, 0.3% of women consume alcohol, below the national average. But 23.1%. of men do so, which is higher than the national average.  The percentage of women who consume alcohol is the highest in Arunachal Pradesh (18%), followed by Sikkim (15%). Alcohol use among men is the highest in Goa (59%), followed by Arunachal Pradesh (57%), and Telangana (50%), while it is the lowest in Lakshadweep (1%).  Among women who drink alcohol, 17% consume it almost every day and 37% drink about once a week. Among men, while 15% consume almost daily, 43% drink about once a week, and 42% do less than once a week.  Drinking alcohol is more common among women from Scheduled Tribes (4%) than from any other caste/tribe group.  Consumption is also most common among Christian men (36%) and men belonging to “other” religions (49%). The “other” religions here are those apart from the Hindu, the Muslim, the Christian, the Sikh, the Buddhist/Neo-Buddhist, and the Jain communities.  Drinking is also seen in 33% of men with less than 5 years of schooling, 34% of those from Scheduled Tribes, and 30%. of those in the age group of 35-49.  Overall the proportion of men who drink alcohol decreased from 29% to 22% between NFHS-4 in 2015-2016 and NFHS-5 in 2019-2021. During that period, the proportion of women who drink has remained unchanged, according to the report.  NIMHANS study  NIMHANS Director Pratima Murthy, who was part of a study found that excessive alcohol consumption can cause irreversible changes to the DNA and that changes may persist even when it is no longer consumed. She said the reduction in alcohol consumption as per the NFHS-5 report could also be due to the non-availability during the COVID-19 lockdown.  The study by NIMHANS, published last year in the American Journal of Medical Genetics, found that the effects of alcohol were more pronounced in those who had started at an early age.  Dr. Murthy told The Hindu that the findings suggest that starting to drink early may physically alter many genes, including those of the brain. “This may have a significant effect on brain development and maturation that may persist to the later adult life,” she said.  Vivek Benegal, Professor of Psychiatry, who heads the Centre for Addiction Medicine at NIMHANS, said that the overall reduction in consumption is a welcome change. However, it needs to be seen in the perspective of the consistent increase in sales and production of alcohol.  “The findings will have to be balanced with consistent increase in sales and production of alcohol during the period when the reduction has been observed,” Dr. Benegal said",Business

15,There’s finally momentum to stop stock trading in Congress,"Bills banning members of Congress from trading stocks are gaining increased bipartisan support — including from a former skeptic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — after a series of investigations involving potential insider trading by lawmakers, particularly in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.  There’s wide agreement among voters that legislators should be banned from trading stocks while in Congress, since their position can give them access to information about companies and industries that ordinary people don’t have. While there are some policies in place to at least provide transparency about how legislators are making money from the stock market, there aren’t significant punishments for violating those rules.  In fact, as Business Insider’s Dave Levinthal reported earlier this month, at least 55 members of Congress violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2021 alone.  The law — better known as the STOCK Act — was passed in 2012 to curtail the use of inside information to trade stocks, but many lawmakers now believe it didn’t go far enough to curb abuses.  Business Insider’s reporting, as well as the high-profile investigations of Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and former Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for suspiciously well-timed trades around the advent of the pandemic, have (somewhat belatedly) spurred new energy around legislation to prevent members of Congress from trading stocks while in office, with multiple bills introduced in the House and Senate aiming to do just that — albeit with varying degrees of stringency, and a lack of clarity regarding who exactly should be targeted.  According to Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen, public frustration with ethical issues — and widespread public support for a stock trading ban — is likely driving the current push.",Business
16,Govt. said to urge Reserve Bank to help push bond yields lower,"Reuters New Delhi  The government has asked the central bank to either buy back government bonds or conduct open market operations to cool yields that have hit their highest since 2019, as inflation risks push foreign investors to sell, a government source told Reuters on Monday.  The 10-year benchmark bond ended at 7.46%, after earlier reaching a high of 7.49%. “The discussion with the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) is at an advanced stage as current yields are not at comfortable levels,” the government official, with direct knowledge of the matter, said on condition of anonymity. The official said government expects the RBI to conduct a switch operation, offering investors a chance to exchange their short-dated bonds for debt with a longer maturity, or to buy back government bonds within the next two weeks.  The request from the government could complicate the RBI’s policy of withdrawing liquidity from the market, which marks a shift away from the ultra-loose monetary stance it took during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The RBI surprised markets last week by raising its key interest rate by 40 basis points to 4.40% to fight inflation — its first increase in nearly four years.  Foreign portfolio investors have sold $697 million of government securities since April 1 and $1.18 billion this year, traders said.  India’s forex reserves fell $2.7 billion to $597.73 billion on April 29, RBI data showed, marking the eighth straight week of declines and the first time falling below $600 billion in a year.",Business

19,Peloton’s big whoops,"Peloton is in a pickle.  In 2020, the at-home digital exercise company could not get its products out the door fast enough. It surpassed $1 billion in quarterly sales during the last three months of the year, and leadership fretted its profits could take a hit as it invested to try to keep pace with pandemic-induced Pelotonpalooza. People waited weeks and months for their bikes and treadmills to be delivered. Alongside companies such as Zoom and Clorox, Peloton’s stock was a solid stay-at-home bet on Wall Street. But nothing lasts forever.  Fast-forward to 2022, and Peloton finds itself in quite a different spot. The good news: It has caught up on the supply side and finally has bikes and treadmills readily available. The bad news: The demand it’s trying to catch up to is no longer there. CNBC’s Lauren Thomas reports that Peloton is going to hit pause on production for a while.  “Peloton has been plagued with a supply-demand mismatch since the pandemic started,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who has been bearish on the company for quite some time. “The problem has basically inverted.”  Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have found out more about the supply chain than they ever imagined. American consumers are accustomed to things just showing up at their doorsteps or on the shelves when they want, no questions asked. Everyone knows about supply and demand theoretically, but everything we’re learning about them in practice now is, to quote the meme, against our will.  The public health crisis has thrown many parts of the economy out of whack, and it’s made doing business more complicated across industry after industry. There have been plenty of well-documented kinks in the supply chain. (Who knew there’d be this surge of interest in shipping containers?) There’s been all sorts of weirdness in demand as well.

21,The case against the Supreme Court of the United States,"Two events occurred Monday night — one historic, the other rather insignificant — which placed an unflattering spotlight on the Supreme Court of the United States.  The historic event was that Politico published an unprecedented leak of a draft majority opinion, by Justice Samuel Alito, which would overrule Roe v. Wade and permit state lawmakers to ban abortion in its entirety in the US. Alito’s draft opinion is not the Court’s final word on this case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, but the leaked opinion is the latest in a long list of signs that Roe may be in its final days.  The other event that also occurred last night is that I sent two tweets.

26,Have we been thinking about economic growth all wrong?,"That’s an alarming-seeming but ultimately misleading number; most of it is accounted for by changes in international trade (imports, which reduce GDP numbers, rose as businesses knew war in Ukraine was coming) and the shrinking of inventories held by businesses as consumers bought them up. “Final sales to domestic purchasers,” which strips out those factors, was up 0.6 percent for the quarter, or 2.6 percent annually.  However you parse the release, though, this seemed as good a time as any to discuss the long-run future of growth in the US and the rest of the world. I’m getting pretty worried about it, to be honest! And I’m worried because of an economics paper by NYU’s Thomas Philippon with the unassuming name “Additive Growth.”  The implication of Philippon’s paper is as simple as it is disturbing: We should expect economic growth to slow down in the long run, and the big leaps forward of the last couple centuries may be an aberration.  This conclusion is far from certain, and it goes against decades of assumptions on how to model economic growth. But Philippon brings a lot of data to bear on his thesis, which makes some intuitive sense, and even the possibility of it being true should alarm us.  The big pile of stuff we know how to do Philippon’s paper is not concerned with economic growth per se, but with a variable that is central to explaining long-run growth: total factor productivity, or TFP.  Defining or getting a handle on the idea of TFP can be tricky. Technically, it’s just a residual: the annual growth rate of TFP is what you get when you look at annual economic growth, and remove the growth attributable to an increase in labor (more hours worked) or capital accumulation (more factories built, labor-saving machines purchased, etc).",Business
27,Andaman to get gas-based power plant,"acob KoshyNew Delhi  The Union Environment Ministry has approved an exemption to the laws governing the regulation of coastal zones and has paved the way for gas-powered plants to be set up on the Andaman and Nicobar islands.  The Island Coastal Zone Regulation (ICRZ), 2019, limits infrastructure development on vulnerable coastal stretches.  Enabling provision  In the aftermath of a proposal from the Andaman and Nicobar Coastal Zone Management Authority (ANCZMA), an expert body of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, called the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA), recommended in August 2021 that it was necessary to provide an “enabling provision in the ICRZ notification” to meet the energy requirement of the islanders while reducing the dependence on highly polluting energy sources such as conventional diesel generator (DG) sets.  The NCZMA has recommended that gas-based power plants be permitted within the Island Coastal Regulation Zone area only on islands with geographical areas greater than 100 sq. km.  The Central government, following this, invited comments from the public on modifications to to the ICZR, and on May 5, issued a notification accepting the National Coastal Zone Management Authority recommendation.  The Andaman and Nicobar administration is expected to commission a 50-MW power project running on liquefied natural gas at Hope Town, Port Blair, to be developed by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).  Following visits by the NTPC personnel, a dual-fuel power plant that runs on both diesel and LNG is expected to be commissioned.  Back-up clause  Diesel is necessary, the Andaman administration authorities argued, as a back-up fuel when the region faced inclement weather.  There has been an increased interest in the development of the Andaman region following a policy push by the NITI Aayog.  A proposed project plans to develop the Greater Andaman region or the southernmost stretch of the island group.  Proposals include a 22-sq.km airport complex, a transshipment port (TSP) at South Bay at an estimated cost of ₹12,000 crore, a parallel-to-the-coast mass rapid transport system and a free trade zone and warehousing complex on the southwestern coast.",Business
28,The awful American consumer,"Some of the angriest emails I’ve ever gotten from readers were over a story about credit card points.  The long and short of it is that the fancier the credit card rewards, the higher the swipe fees for merchants. Those merchants often pass along the costs of those swipe fees to all customers, whatever the payment mechanism. People who pay with rewards cards tend to be more well-off, financially, and their hotel points or flight miles are being, in part, subsidized by people paying in cash or debit who tend to be poorer. A 2010 paper found that households that use cash pay about $149 on average to households that use credit cards, and each of the credit card households gets $1,133 from cash users every year.  Essentially, credit card rewards have to come from somewhere, and they’re partly coming from people who aren’t reaping the benefits. Some readers were very angry to discover this information. “Maybe it’s time for people who don’t want to work to know how it feels to foot the bill for other people?” one person wrote to me, apparently equating having a rewards card with having a job. “If people want a better life I suggest education and getting a degree or a certificate in a trade,” wrote another person. “Boohoohoo. Who cares?” wrote another.  Some people seemed to feel that they had a serious right to accumulate credit card rewards, regardless of who or what those rewards were coming from. It’s a sentiment that bears out in the data: A 2019 LendingTree survey found that people were likelier to support a rate cap on credit cards if it reduced access for people with imperfect credit than they were if it meant it would significantly lower their rewards.  “What that essentially says is that more people [were] okay with fewer folks having access to credit than they were with having their own credit card rewards shrink,” explained Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email.  That consumers can be selfish isn’t a new phenomenon. Remember when everyone was hoarding toilet paper and masks at the start of the pandemic?

In one corner lined by earthen lamps, a song is in the air as artistes hug each other a little too tight, after two bleak years. In another, people sway gently to the guitar tunes. The scene is bittersweet; a breath of fresh air. Remembering Veenapani, the non-ticketed annual theatre festival that commemorates Veenapani Chawla, the founder of Adishakti, is thus back again after two years. And the feeling of warmth is familiar.     The theatre is packed. Andrés Fagiolino and Betina Domínguez from Uruguay, armed with antics and heavily powdered faces, are on a wild search amid many coffee cups hung from above. They are searching for ‘maashi’. What is ‘maashi’? Some in the audience say it’s magic. It could be hope or even a commodity like, say, water. They clown their way through a narrative that is both simple and abstract, with effortless physicality (handstands and human flags galore). Amares Teatro, as the duo is called, has travelled extensively across the world with their clowning techniques. Their play Rio captures the relationship between two individuals in the face of scarcity, which received thunderous applause and a rather lengthy standing ovation at Adishakti last week.   Enveloped by the afternoon lull, Andrés and Betina sit down for a conversation before the much-anticipated performance. Their glances to each other speak of an obvious chemistry that translates well on stage. The duo has been travelling performers since 2015. While Andres, who has a background in Biochemistry, strayed into hospital clowning purely by chance in 2007, Betina has been a circus artiste since she was 13 years old.   “In 2015, I met Andrés and we started travelling along with four others, who taught me more about clowning and physical theatre,” says Betina. After touring in Latin America, Amares Teatro had been in Kenya and Egypt before arriving in India, to perform Rio non-verbally. “It was originally written by us in 2016 and premiered in Ecuador, in Spanish. The beauty of the show is that it adapts to its audiences, irrespective of geographical boundaries, which is essentially what clowning is,” says Andrés. “Clowning is about live conversations. While we are talking to you, we adapt to you and you may adapt to us. It is set in the present,” says Andres. He adds, “The basic dramaturgy is still, but there are always gaps that adapt to the environment and the day we perform in.” For instance, they use words, noises and inflections throughout the play to connect with the audience: and those words, most often gibberish, will be repeatedly used in reference to a concept or idea, much like ‘maashi’ in Rio.  And so, the duo’s repertoire is spread across monasteries, hospitals, kindergartens and prisons, miles away from the conventional stage. Betina recalls the experience of performing in a women’s penitentiary in Peru to an audience of about 500 prisoners. “They were reacting a lot to the little things I did. They had a lot of contained energy. It was a very powerful show,” says Betina. And such experiences are what makes clowning more rewarding than any other form of theater Finally, being a clown is also a journey within, says Andrés. “Clowning teaches you to see things as is, without hiding it away,” Betina quips in. The lightness or humor in clowning does not necessarily lend to shallowness, as many think. As puts it, “We say that clowns come from innocence; but they arrive from innocence after experience. Innocence may be child-like, but not childish.”",Entertainment
30,‘Prithviraj’ trailer launch: Akshay Kumar calls historical ‘an educational film to be shown in schools’,"Akshay Kumar on Monday said his upcoming historical film ""Prithviraj"" should be mandatory viewing for children in schools as it talks about king Prithviraj Chauhan, who has been reduced to ""only a paragraph"" in history.  Directed by noted writer-director Chandraparaksh Dwivedi, the film features Kumar in the titular role of the ruler. During the trailer launch event of the historical drama, the 54-year-old actor said he learnt about the life and times of Prithviraj through the book ""Prithviraj Raso"" and realised how little people know about the ruler.  ""I was given a book to read, 'Prithviraj Raso' by Dr saab (Dwivedi). I read the book slowly and realised how big a warrior he was. But when we read about him in history, he was reduced to just a paragraph,"" Kumar told reporters.  The actor said ""Prithviraj"" can be best described as an ""educational film"" and hoped the younger generation watches it for better understanding of history. ""Today, I want every child, not just in India but in the world to watch the film. It is an educational film. You would want to show your kids what Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan's story was. I am extremely proud to work in the film. I wish my mother... If she was here, she would have been so proud,"" Kumar, who lost his mother last year, said.  The actor also requested the government to arrange the film's screening in schools so that it reaches a wider audience.  Kumar said ""Prithviraj"" has been painstakingly researched and chronicles only the ""truth"".  ""I would also request the government that they make it compulsory viewing in school, so that the kids learn about our history, what and how everything happened.  ""Everything you see in the film is true, it has indeed happened. But we don't know about it and I find this really amusing. Dr saab has been researching this for 18 years! That's the amount of hardwork he has put in the film,"" he added.  Dwivedi is best known for directing and starring in television epic “Chanakya” (1991) and the Partition feature film “Pinjar” (2003).",Entertainment
31,Breaking the barrier by teaching Bharatanatyam to Irula girls,"It looks like an unlikely setting for a Bharatanatyam class. The stamping of feet on the floor in tune with the jathis of Bharatanatyam fills the small hall with a tin roof of the Thai Tamil Palli at Tindivanam. Bharatanatyam dancer and Fulbright Scholar in Residence Kausalya Srinivasan beats the thattu palakai and a group of seven girls belonging to the Irular community are learning their first lessons in dancing.  “It is the traditional dance of Tamil Nadu and take pride in learning it,” Ms. Srinivasan tells the students as she constantly corrects their posture.  “The way you stand, the way to speak, and the way you make gestures matter a lot. It will improve your body language, confidence and personality,” reiterates Ms. Srinivasan, who seeks to break the barrier by teaching classical dance to the girls on the margins of society.  The girls are attentive though it takes some time for them to adjust themselves to the discomforts of the new attire of the dancers brought to them by Ms. Srinivasan.  “I never thought I would learn Bharatanatyam in my life. Who would have taught us? I wanted to dance when other students in my college participated in cultural programmes. One day, I will also dance on the dais,” said I. Sakthi, who studies B.Sc physics at the A. Govindsamy Government Arts College, Tindivanam.  “I wonder how she [Ms. Srinivasan] always has a cheerful demeanour and sounds confident. I feel I can also be [always cheerful] like her if I dance,” she said.  For K. Bhuvana and M. Gunasundarai, the Class 9 students, the dream has come true. “I liked to dance at school functions. But never had the opportunity or confidence. I will learn it well,” Bhuvana said on Sunday.  Ms. Srinivasan decided to teach Bharatanatyam to underprivileged children after participating in the Millennium Stage created with the objective of making performing arts accessible to everyone in fulfillment of the U.S.-based Kennedy Centre’s mission to its community and the nation.  When she approached retired Madras High Court judge K. Chandru, he advised her to meet Professor Kalyani, founder of Thai Tamil Palli, who works among the Irulas and fights for their rights. After a couple of meetings with Mr. Kalyani, she decided to go ahead.  “I liked the idea because I feel a person’s personality will not be complete without learning an art. Art will give confidence to students,” said Mr. Kalyani, who also wanted Ms. Srinvasan to include some students from his school [in her classes].  Asked whether these students could get a space on stage, especially when classical dances remain an exclusive domain of a privileged section, Ms. Srinivasan said she would create a space for them. “We have to begin somewhere. I will organise their arangetram one day. Since they are students, I will recommend their name for the Fulbright scholarship so that they could study in the U.S.,” she added.",Entertainment
32,India urged to conduct lawful probe after Xiaomi allegations,"Ananth Krishnan Hong Kong  China’s government on Monday asked India to carry out investigations “in accordance with laws”, following claims of coercion from smartphone maker Xiaomi during ongoing investigations into its financial practices.  India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday said claims of Xiaomi India’s officials that their statements were taken “under coercion” were “untrue and baseless”. It noted it had recorded statements from Manu Kumar Jain, former head of Xiaomi India and current Global VP, as well as Chief Financial Officer Sameer Rao.  The ED said the last statement from them was recorded on April 26 while the order to seize the company’s assets was passed three days later. “No complaint was filed by them at any point of time during recording of statements at various occasions,” the agency said, adding that “it appears that allegation now made after passage of substantial time is an afterthought.”  The Karnataka High Court on Saturday stayed the April 29 order, under which ₹5,551.27 crore was seized under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, the Press Trust of India reported.  ‘Closely monitoring’  In its first comments on the developments, China’s Foreign Ministry on Monday said it was “closely monitoring the matter.”  “The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies overseas to operate in accordance with laws and regulations,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. “In the meantime, we firmly support Chinese companies in protecting their lawful rights and interests. We hope the Indian side can provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies making investment and operating in the country, and conduct investigation and law enforcement in accordance with laws and regulations so as to beef up the international community’s confidence in investment.”  Xiaomi India, in a court filing, claimed that its officials were threatened with consequences if they did not submit compliant statements, allegations that the ED has rejected.  The company’s operations in India have been under investigation over remittance payments which authorities said were illegal. Xiaomi, however, has maintained the payments were royalties. A hearing in the case is set for later this week.",Entertainment
33,"Photographer Mike Sullivan, who was recently in India, uses his masks to explore the performative nature of identity","The process of mask making started out very impulsively for Mike. And very soon it became an extension of himself, and a way to communicate with the world Shards of mirrors, feathers, jewels, delicate leaves and flowers. These are the objects American artist and photographer Mike Sullivan, 28, uses to tell his stories, with the help of the masks and headpieces he fashions.  To Mike, these are not just objects of beauty, but a safe space for the wearer. “People are incredibly vulnerable when we are creating an image together. Masks and crowns help them feel an inner sense of liberation and self worth,” he says. Mike visited India at the start of the year, and the three weeks he spent between Kerala, Goa and Karnataka became an impromptu creative residency. He explored local flower markets, jewellery shops and collaborated with artists along the way, including Goa-based photographer Pretika Menon. “I created far more than I expected and am extremely grateful for how open people were,” he says.  It was his training in theatre in Ithaca College, New York, followed by a semester at Ithaca College London Center, that led him to grow deeply interested in mask making. “For a Shakespeare/Grecian section of the semester, we had to create and perform in our own masks, which was the first leg in my journey as a mask maker.”",Entertainment

36,Santoor maestro Shivkumar Sharma passes away,"Pt. Shivkumar Sharma, veteran santoor maestro, passed away in Mumbai due to cardiac arrest. He was 84. Hailing from Jammu, Pt. Shivkumar, put the multiple-string santoor at the centre stage. He adapted the instrument to play Hindustani music and became its foremost exponent. He was also suffering from renal ailments.  Along with celebrated flautist Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia, he also composed music for many Hindi films. His son and disciple Rahul, a santoor artiste, has been taking his father's legacy forward.  Sharma, one of India’s most well-known classical musicians, was due to perform in Bhopal next week. “He had a severe heart attack at around 9 a.m. He was active and was to perform in Bhopal next week. He was on regular dialysis but was still was active,” the family source told PTI.

37,Ruskin Bond: transcending time,"R. Krithika  A young boy discovers a hidden pool inside a forest and rushes to inform his two best friends. The three embark on an exploration of the area. They swim, try fishing, ride the buffaloes that wallow in the pool, even try to enlarge the pool by building a dam.  It is 1857, India is in a ferment. When Ruth’s father is killed by the Indian soldiers, the family finds shelter in a friend’s house. But Javed Khan, the Pathan leader of the rebels, finds them and kidnaps them. He falls in love with Ruth but her mother will not allow her daughter to marry a rebel.  If the first, The Hidden Pool, left you musing about friendships and relationships that fall by the wayside; A Flight of Pigeons took one back into a tumultuous time. Two very different books by the same author. For many, Ruskin Bond is a children’s author. No doubt, he is. But Bond, who turns 88 on May 19, is also much more given that his writing includes novels, essays, short stories, and memoirs.  Coming of age  In his Lone Fox Dancing, Bond offers a moving account of his early years and, for good measure, references many of his stories. However, what was disappointing was to learn that all those fascinating tales of his eccentric grandfather were “either made up or based on hearsay”. His life with his father and later his mother and stepfather, trip to England and return to India, which he considers home, are all dealt with here.  His first book, The Room on The Roof about a young boy’s coming of age, was based on his own experiences of living in a rented room in Dehradun. It won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1957. Bond was then in London trying to make a living. The publication of this novel allowed him to return to India. “All I really wanted was my little room back again,” he writes in his autobiography.  Following his return, he settled in Mussoorie and began to write stories for magazines and newspapers. Rusty, his protagonist in The Room on the Roof, makes a comeback in Vagrants in the Valley. As you laugh over Rusty’s and Kishen’s adventures, you cannot help but muse over what loneliness and friendship mean to different people.  On the silver screen  A short story collection about Rusty followed and the stories found their place in school textbooks and were even adapted for a television show. Other short stories like The Blue Umbrella and Susanna’s Seven Husbands were adapted as feature films, as was his novel A Flight of Pigeons. Bond even made a cameo appearance in Saat Khoon Maaf, which was based on Susanna’s Seven Husbands.  Most of his stories hark back to another time — of simple lives and small places where everyone knew everyone. But what keeps the reader coming back to them is the emotion that infuses the words. Bond’s people are real; ones you probably know and are familiar with. And their lives are unpredictable, just like ours. In Friends in Small Places, Bond writes that dull people “are those whose lives are too orderly or those who are forever boasting of the ease with which they have succeeded in life.”  Painting nature  Then there are his descriptions of nature. His use of words is sparse but the pictures they paint are vivid. Take these lines from his short story The Leopard: “The stream ran close by the verge, tumbling over smooth pebbles, over rocks worn yellow with age, on its way to the plains and to the little Song River and finally to the sacred Ganga.” The complete life-cycle of a stream is conjured up without fuss. Without being moralistic or preachy, the story also calls for co-existence with wild animals.  And his ghost stories! A personal favourite is A Face in the Dark, which has found its way into school textbooks. The tale is about a teacher’s encounters with a strange boy and a school watchman but what leaves you thirsting is that you don’t know what happens at the end. There’s no neat denouement; just more suspense.  As I think of the pleasure his writing has given me, I can’t help but recall what he said about his writing: “I’m like a shopkeeper hoarding bags full of grains; only, I hoard words. There are still people who buy words and I hope I can keep bringing a little sunshine and pleasure into their lives to the end of my days.” I hope you’ll be doing that for a long time yet, Mr. Bond.",Entertainment
38,Ji Chang-wook smiles again in ‘The Sound of Magic’,"The actor, who steps into the musical fantasy genre with his new Netflix drama, The Sound of Magic, talks about broadening his range and choosing with his heart He was the mysterious night courier in Healer, the suave secret agent in The K2, and the tyrannical emperor in Empress Ki. Ji Chang-wook’s versatility and good looks are often discussed in the same breath. Now, he is back on screen as the enigmatic and free-spirited magician Ri-eul, in The Sound of Magic.  Directed by Kim Sung-youn, who previously helmed the hit series Iteawon Class (2020) and Love in the Moonlight (2016), it is a screen adaptation of the popular webtoon, Annarasumanara.  Over a morning video call, Chang-wook explains how he is no stranger to the stage. He was a returning member on the musical, The Days, through 2013 to 2016. The challenge, however, for both him and director Sung-youn, lay in adapting comic artist Ha Il-kwon’s black-and-white illustrations to a colourful musical fantasy.  For the 34-year-old, the project was an opportunity to showcase his repertoire as a performer. “The music, choreography and vocal training reminded me of my theatre days. Playing this magician who is child-like, frank and emotional on the one hand, but also mysterious, appealed to me,” he says. Chang-wook, one of the most searched names across social media, is completing 15 years in show business. The actor who shot to fame as speed skater Dong Hae in Smile Again (2010) has carved a niche for himself as the action hero, with dramas such as Healer (2014), The K2 (2016) and Fabricated City (2017). However, he now wants to widen his range. After completing his military service in 2019, several of his projects, including Melting Me Softly, Backstreet Rookies and Love Struck in the City were met with lukewarm response. He says his choices are instinctive. “For me, it’s quite personal. [I choose] depending on what interests me at that moment. It’s also important that the script is engaging.”  While he admits that he has not “set any standards for myself as such”, he adds that he wants to do roles that resonate with him. He signed The Sound of Magic almost immediately because the story — of lost childhood dreams and growing pains — struck an emotional chord. “It brought back memories of my own growing up years, of the death of my father and the difficulties we went through as a family,” he says, adding “It drew me to this story of hope and miracles.” ",Entertainment

40,"Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, and their $50 million defamation suit, explained","America is watching the defamation trial of Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard in Fairfax, Virginia, and America appears to be deeply confused by it. Vanity Fair reports that as Court TV broadcasts the trial, it has doubled its daytime ratings. Hashtags associated with the trial have repeatedly trended across Twitter, as viewers watch and discuss the celebrity case of the year — its messiness, its scandal, the glamorous movie stars at its heart, and the question of what to believe and how much.  This is a murky, perplexing trial. While it’s technically a defamation trial over a newspaper article — with Depp suing Heard — at its center is one big conflict. Amber Heard says Johnny Depp abused her. Depp says Heard abused him. So what’s the truth?  Strikingly for our post-Me Too world, it looks as though the loudest voices on the internet have overwhelmingly sided with Depp. While there’s compelling evidence that there was violence on both sides of this marriage, it’s not quite so clear that the evidence supports Depp’s story, or that he has much of a shot at winning this case.  What Depp does have is the stronger public profile. Though it’s been over a decade since he put out a true critical hit, he’s delivered enough acclaimed work over the course of his long career to earn himself a fair amount of goodwill.  The star of hits like Edward Scissorhands, Donnie Brasco, and the many, many Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Depp has been nominated for three Oscars and been named People’s Sexiest Man Alive twice. For a while, at least, he was one of those people who are so bankable that they seem able to get away with anything: a white man who is also a true A-list sex symbol. He was up there in the upper echelon: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Johnny Depp.  As Depp’s film career declined over the course of the 2010s, his personal and financial troubles began. In 2017, Depp sued both his longtime business managers and his entertainment lawyer, claiming they had mismanaged his finances.",Entertainment

45,"Richa Chadha on playing a sex worker, the world of audio shows, and more","Actor Richa Chadha, after delivering multiple striking performances on-screen, is now busy exploring the world of audio. Chadha, alongside Jaideep Ahlawat, plays a sex worker in Audible’s latest show, Baby Doll, a revenge drama based in the hinterland.  Baby (Chadha) is a hurt and humiliated sex worker, who takes on a dreaded underworld don, played by Jaideep Ahlawat, to avenge the violent death of her friend.  Richa talks to us about the show, the politics of the sex trade in the country and her upcoming projects. I have done audio shows before, but it is my first time doing a pure Hindi hinterland (audio) show and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. You get to engage the audience with purely your voice; you have nothing else to offer. It is just a whole world created by the sound programmer and foley artist.   In terms of preparation, we did multiple readings. My accent had to be diluted to reflect my character’s background; the readings helped me figure out the right voice.   [A foley artist creates sound effects in a studio during post-production. These sounds include anything from the sound of a glass breaking to the sound of footsteps and a punch landing on a person’s face]  Did you work with any dialect coaches for the show?  No (laughs) I know the belt the story is set in very well, and I am quite good at picking up different Indian accents, so I did not work with any dialect coaches.  How does the visual aesthetic of a character translate to audio shows? Is it solely based on voice modulation and dialect?  For us, it is just voice acting and then the production work begins, where you add sound effects of what is happening from the world the character belongs to. So it is just a good high-level foley with a good sound designer. That is pretty much it.   Do you see audio shows becoming a part of the mainstream? Will we have a new crop of voice actors?   There are already people who are making careers out of voice acting. There are incredibly talented voice-over artists and theatre actors who have a trained and rehearsed voice with grain and texture. So I think the time is already here. And despite the pandemic, there has been an explosion in the audio world.  Is the format a little restricting in terms of genre? For instance, do you see a superhero audio film reaching the audience?  Definitely, I see superhero films adapting to the audio format. There are already detective shows and thrillers, and there’s only space to grow, because it is easy to produce these shows as well. You just need a good sound programmer; you don’t need thousands of crores to depict a very large scene of a battlefield. You can do it with sound alone, and that’s what makes it fun.  How did you prepare to play the role of a sex worker?  I had previously worked on Love Sonia, and during the preparation for that movie, I met a lot of sex workers. I knew of their world before coming on board this show, and that definitely helped.  What do you make of the politics surrounding sex workers in the country?  People don’t fully understand what happens in the lives of sex workers. When people fight for the legalisation of sex work, it does not mean they are fighting to expand the industry. There are multiple instances where young girls are trafficked from their houses, and if you sort of work towards legalisation, these people will have rights.   If you hear my character’s backstory, it is very tragic. I have met sex workers who were trafficked when they were as young as six or seven. If you want to visit hell on earth, you should visit a brothel.   It’s not like the trade is going away... but if we legalise it, then we will have the means to put an end to incidents of trafficking.  What can you tell us about your character in Baby Doll?  My character is a woman with nothing to lose, and she draws her courage from that. The audience should just see how she manages to extract revenge or justice after going through hell. She is someone who doesn’t give up, and is very focused on what she wants.  How is the actor-director relationship when it comes to audio shows?  The actor-director relationship is quite similar to that of conventional movies. The director and writer, Pravesh Bhardwaj, was looking at me from the other room of the dubbing studio and was giving me cues. You know, in some old movies you see people directing the artist in a dubbing studio through a glass screen? It was very similar to that!  Do you see yourself doing more audio shows in the future?  I hope so, as they are very rewarding. I come across people’s experiences listening to these in the fan mail, and it’s really gratifying. I really think there is a world out here that is waiting to be explored.  Would you like to talk about your future projects? A lot of work has come my way. So I am analysing what is better for me; work that will be creatively satisfying. Speaking specifically, there is Fukrey’s third instalment, the second season Great Indian Murder in which we finally solve the case, and at least three films I need to finish between September and December.

47,‘Tagore remains a tree sheltering people in tough times’,"Bishwanath Ghosh Kolkata  Nature — celebrated in its various forms and moods by Rabindranath Tagore — decided to assert itself with pre-cyclonic rains in Bengal as it celebrated the poet’s birthday, which falls on the 25th day of the month of Baisakh and therefore, usually varies from the English date of May 7.  People from both West Bengal and Bangladesh, poetic in their tribute to modern India’s tallest literary figure on his 161st birth anniversary, asserted that Tagore remained the large banyan tree under which almost every Bengali-speaking person sought either joy or shelter. The general consensus — as numerous celebrations took place in this part of the sub-continent — was that his thoughts and his works, far from being outdated, were even more relevant today.  “Our Tagore eats popcorn. He watches Netflix. He is today and tomorrow. As we hear a symphony in Berlin, strains of his Bipulo tarango re sail through. As we see Satyajit Ray’s Apu walking, Ami chanchal hey automatically plays in the back of our minds. As we read Harry Potter, we find him sitting beside us. He is an elderly friend, guiding us through good times and bad times,” the musician-duo of Sourendro-Soumyojit, highly popular for their three-part album Tagore and We, told The Hindu.  Acutely relevant  Writer Parimal Bhattacharya, who today finds Tagore’s pronouncements on nationalism, civilisation, education and environment growing more acutely relevant, discovered the poet rather late in life. “I grew up in a typical bhadralok family. There was the mandatory 27-volume collected works of Tagore, and his picture on the drawing-room wall. Familiarity breeds indifference, and in my early youth I was attracted to Bengali writers like Buddhadeva Bose and Sunil Gangopadhyay, who were vocal critics of Tagore. I discovered the best of Tagore rather late and it was overwhelming,” said Mr. Bhattacharya.  On the other hand, what influenced cancer researcher-turned-comic artist Argha Manna was not Tagore’s poetry but his art.  “Tagore as a painter intrigued and fascinated me more. To me, he was the best contemporary artist in India, ahead of his time. His art somehow reminds me of art from the pre-Second World War Weimer Republic, Germany. Among different art movements throughout the course of history, the German Expressionism movement makes the deepest impact on me. Tagore’s art resembles the expressionist artist’s work. Not subject-wise or skill-wise, but philosophy-wise. His artworks are examples of raw expression of brain-eye-hand coordination,” Mr. Manna said.  Ahead of time; timeless — these are tributes that came from across the border in Bangladesh as well. While Dhaka-based photographer Jannatul Mawa said that Tagore propagated eco-friendliness long before the world began to discover eco-friendly ways of living; educationist Hena Sultana, associated with the Narayanganj-based Kumudini Welfare Trust, called him a time-conquering tree that sheltered people during sudden rains.  Ms. Mawa said: “His songs offer solutions to life’s problems — they serve as a manual for life. His words made it easier for me to cope with the pandemic.”  Kolkata-based singer Ratna Basu specialises in Sufi songs and doesn’t sing Rabindra Sangeet, but it is Tagore’s words that see her through difficult times. “He is the ultimate refuge,” Ms. Basu said.",Entertainment
48,Marcos Jr. leads in Philippines elections,"Agence France-Presse Manila  The son of late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos on Tuesday headed for a historic landslide victory in the country’s presidential election, after Filipinos brushed aside warnings about weakening of their already fragile democracy.  Nearly 40 years after his namesake father was deposed by a popular revolt and his family chased into exile, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had garnered more than double the number of votes of his nearest rival, according to an unofficial tally of results.  With more than 84% of precincts reporting, Mr. Marcos had received over 27 million votes against liberal candidate Leni Robredo’s 12.9 million.  If sustained, the tally — published by local media from Commission on Elections figures — would make Mr. Marcos the first Philippine President since his father’s ouster to be elected with an absolute majority.  Historic turnaround  It would also signal an astonishing turnaround for the fortunes of the Marcos clan, who have come from being pariahs to in reach of the presidential palace in a generation.  Mr. Marcos’ campaign was marked by a relentless online whitewashing of his father’s brutal and corrupt regime, as well as an embrace of current authoritarian President Rodrigo Duterte, who retains widespread popular support.  Before polling day, rights activists, Catholic leaders and political analysts had warned Mr. Marcos could rule with an even heavier fist if he wins by a large margin.  Delivering a late-night address from his campaign headquarters in Manila, a tired but beaming Mr. Marcos thanked volunteers for months of “sacrifices and work”. But he stopped short of claiming victory, warning that “the count is not yet done”.  “Let’s wait until it’s very clear, until the count reaches a hundred percent then we can celebrate.”",Politics

The Punjab police team taking Mr Bagga to Mohali was stopped en route by Haryana cops after the Delhi police registered a kidnapping case based on a complaint by Mr Bagga's father.   In a video statement, Delhi BJP spokesperson Naveen Kumar Jindal claimed around 50 cops barged into Mr Bagga's Delhi home at around 8:30 in the morning and arrested him. ""He couldn't even wear his turban,"" he said.  Mr Bagga's father has claimed that he was punched in the face when he attempted to capture the incident on video. Talking to news agency ANI, he said, ""This morning, 10-15 police personnel came to our home and dragged Tajinder out. When I picked up my mobile phone to record a video of the incident, police took me to another room and punched me in the face.""  The Punjab police say they had sent notice to Mr Bagga five times to join the investigation but he refused to comply.   Mr Bagga will now be taken to a Punjab court after legal action in Delhi. The complaint was registered with the cyber cell at Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar in Punjab's Mohali district.  Mr Bagga has been very vocal against Arvind Kejriwal on social media.

50,"""Was Hit 30 To 35 Times"": Hyderabad Woman On Husband's Murder In Public","Hyderabad: Her husband was beaten to death with an iron road on a busy road in Hyderabad and a crowd couldn't save him, though she begged for help. Syed Ashrin Sulthana later told the police the killers were her brother and his friends. She wants them brought to justice. Newlywed Sulthana entered her husband B Nagaraju's home for the first time after his death two days ago. She says she will live in his childhood home, with his memories, till the day she dies.  Nagaraju, a Hindu, died instantly after the attack by his Muslim wife's brother.  Dazed with grief, Sulthana, 21, holds tight to a framed photo of Nagaraju as Lord Krishna as she speaks to NDTV on the horror of Wednesday evening.  ""My husband and I were going on a bike. He slowed down a little to cross the road, suddenly two bikes came. I didn't realise my brother was on one of them. They pushed my husband, he fell. They started hitting him with rods. When I tried to save him, my brother's friends pushed me. I pleaded for help but people took videos,"" she said.  It was all over within moments, but she felt people had enough time to intervene and stop the attack. She feels she wasted precious seconds asking for help that never came.  ""In 10 to 15 minutes, my husband was hit 30 to 35 times with a rod. They hit my husband on his brain.  When he died and when I touched his head, my hand went right through... his brain had spilled out. I wasted my time asking people for help, trusting society. I could have used that time to do something more to help my husband. My husband didn't even realise my brother killed him... Twenty people could have stopped four people.""  Nagaraju, a 25-year-old car salesman, and Sulthana, married on January 31, defying her family, which was rabidly opposed to her marrying outside her faith.  But the two had known each other since school and were madly in love. Their love, they felt, would prevail and win. Religion had never bothered them before.  ""There was always a threat from my family. I had told Raju to marry someone else as there was a problem. I tried to persuade him for two months. But he said we will live together and die together. Even if we have to go somewhere far away after marriage. He said I am ready to die for you. Today, my husband did end up dying, because of me. I feel if I had let him marry someone else, he would have lived,"" Sulthana shared.  ""Being here, in Raju's childhood home, I feel like I am with him.""  Her mother-in-law presses her to drink her juice and she does, reluctantly -  two women, united in grief.  Sulthana cannot get the gruesome images out of her mind - her husband lying lifeless on the road, his head a mess of blood, flesh and bits of brain.  In the 10 years she had known Nagaraju, Sulthana had never seen him in pain. Yet she saw him die in the most horrific way.  ""I thought I couldn't even survive one minute without my husband. But I am here, talking to you, because I am angry with my brother. All I want is that they suffer for how my husband died,"" she said.  ""My brother beat me the day before my wedding, on January 30. He locked me in a room and told me to hang myself.""",Politics

The resignation was accepted, according to a gazette notification, and consequently, the Cabinet stands dissolved as per the Sri Lankan Constitution.  Three persons died outside the capital in ensuing clashes, while at least 150 were injured in Colombo. Government MP Amarakeerthi Athukorala reportedly shot two persons and then himself after being surrounded by a mob in the neighbouring Gampaha district, the police told AFP. Homes of several ruling party lawmakers were torched, while some among anti-government protesters assaulted government supporters who turned up in Colombo, amid escalating violence on the streets.  An AFP reporter said shots were fired from inside the Sri Lankan Prime Minister’s official residence Temple Trees, as thousands of protesters breached the main gate and torched a truck at the entrance. The police also fired tear gas to push back protesters retaliating against an attack on them earlier in the day by those loyal to Mr. Mahinda.  Police sources confirmed that shots were fired in the air to prevent the crowd breaching the inner security ring of the residence where Mr. Mahinda was holed up.",Politics
52,Shaheen Bagh residents see ‘divisive agenda’ behind drive,"Samridhi Tewari NEW DELHI  Syed Farhan, a Shaheen Bagh resident, observed the lone bulldozer brought by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to his locality on Monday morning with great interest. “For a long time, the officials stood beside the bulldozer trying to spot an encroachment,” Farhan told The Hindu.  “After a few hours, the officials directed the bulldozer towards a temporary scaffolding. However, before the officials could take any action, many locals came forward and removed it themselves. Following this, the SDMC people left the spot.”  While the South civic body ended up not carrying out any ‘anti-encroachment’ activity, which was part of the “massive demolition campaign” promised by Mayor Mukesh Suryan last month, the presence of police personnel and a bulldozer ended up infuriating several residents here who saw a “divisive agenda” at play behind the entire exercise. Many of them protested against the drive.  “In a city like Delhi, it is common for municipalities to go after makeshift stalls and for the vendors to pack up and flee. But what is worrying is the manner in which specific areas and communities are being targeted,” said Mohammad Abuzar Chaudhary, a social activist and local resident. He added that the anti-encroachment drives were creating an environment of fear among poor Muslim families living in these areas.   A senior SDMC official said they did not find any temporary stalls in Shaheen Bagh causing obstruction in traffic movement.   “We wanted to remove these encroachments but the stall owners had already cleared them. During the drive, we noticed that a building had a scaffolding which was disrupting the right of way. It had to be removed as per protocol. This is a routine exercise, we were not trying to disrupt the peace in the area,” said the senior SDMC official.  One resident spoke in favour of the drive, arguing that makeshift stalls in the area were indeed obstructing movement.  “The residents of the area have no role to play as the vendors are from different areas. The vendors keep putting up their stalls wherever they wish and keep changing their locations,” said Syed Shamsher Alam.",Politics
53,"Biden Wants Ukraine Aid Passed Immediately, Separate From COVID-19 Funding","Democrats initially wanted to pair the aid packages together to ensure passage of both. The shift means Ukraine aid will likely move forward, but the fate of pandemic relief is uncertain.  President Joe Biden is shifting strategy with additional aid for Ukraine and more COVID-19 funding languishing for weeks: Pass them separately and prioritize emergency funds to counter the Russian invasion in order to avoid further delays.  The move is almost certain to ensure that tens of billions of dollars in new military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine will pass in the near future. Like the last round of aid approved in March, there’s overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress for additional help for Ukraine as it enters the third month of Russia’s invasion. Biden urged swift passage, warning that he’s already “nearly exhausted” the previous funding of nearly $14 billion.  Late last month, Biden requested another $33 billion, and after conversations with leadership, he said in a statement he expects Congress will “likely to pass it in substantially the form I proposed.” The fate, however, of additional funding to restore the federal government’s coronavirus testing, vaccine and therapeutics capacity is much more unpredictable and could face significant roadblocks once again from Republicans and perhaps even some Democrats. As he proposed new Ukrainian aid, Biden reiterated his call for $22.5 billion in pandemic relief, though senators instead struck a much more slimmed down $10 billion bipartisan deal last month.  “I have been informed by Congressional leaders in both parties that such an addition would slow down action on the urgently needed Ukrainian aid – a view expressed strongly by several Congressional Republicans,” Biden said in a Monday statement. “Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away.”  “However let me be clear: as vital as it is to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat COVID,” he added. “So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days. And then, I urge Congress to move promptly on the COVID funding bill.”  Coronavirus funding, specifically, has been tied up in Congress for weeks. The Senate failed to advance the $10 billion in funding in early April after Republicans blocked the procedural vote. As a part of the bill, they wanted an amendment vote on delaying the end of Title 42, the public health order implemented by the Trump administration in 2020 allowing the expulsion of migrants who cross the border because of pandemic concerns.  Since Biden’s announcement that he’d wind down Title 42 on May 23, Republicans and a growing number of Democrats – moderates and ones facing tough reelection races in November – have been seeking a delay and want a detailed plan from the administration if there’s an influx of migrants at the border once it lifts. The plan, however, could be put on hold after a federal judge in Louisiana issued a temporary restraining order against reversing Title 42 before the May deadline.  Democrats were initially angling to pair the Ukraine and COVID-19 funding to ensure the latter passed and dare Republicans to vote against financial help for the eastern European country. Leadership and Biden saw that as the best chance to get pandemic aid through.  But now that the president wants to unlink them and pass Ukraine aid first, Democrats will now need to confront more political hurdles. If Republicans keep up their demands for a vote on Title 42 as part of any coronavirus funding, Democrats will need to decide whether to budge.  With a split 50-50 Senate, both aid packages will need to secure some Republican support in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to avoid the threat of a filibuster. While it seems very likely there will be more than 10 GOP votes for the Ukraine aid, the same isn’t certain for the other.",Politics

While the Supreme Court, unlike the previous instance when the North Delhi Municipal Corporation carried out demolitions in Jahangirpuri last month, refused to intervene or stay the exercise on a petition by the CPI(M)’s Delhi unit, the drive was halted due to stiff resistance from residents of Shaheen Bagh as hundreds of people gathered on the streets and atop buildings.  ‘Found already removed’  A senior SDMC official also said the encroachments that were previously found along the stretch were found to be “already removed”.",Politics

Mr Jaishankar made the remarks while addressing the gathering here for the celebration of 74 years of independence of Israel.  ""When I look back at our relationship, in the last several years that I have been associated with, for me the goosebumps moment in a way was at Tel Aviv when the PM visited Israel in July 2017, first Indian PM to visit Israel. And, since then our relationship has really taken off,"" the EAM said.

57,Vladimir Putin Apologised For Russia Hitler Claims: Israel PM's Office,"Jerusalem, Undefined: Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Thursday that Russian leader Vladimir Putin has apologised for remarks made by Moscow's top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, who claimed Adolf Hitler may have had ""Jewish blood"".  The comments had sparked outrage in the Jewish state.  ""The Prime Minister accepted President Putin's apology for Lavrov's remarks and thanked him for clarifying his attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust,"" Bennett's office said in a statement.   A Kremlin summary of the Bennett-Putin call, which came as Israel marked 74 years since the creation of the Jewish state, made no mention of a Putin apology.   It did, however, note that the leaders discussed the ""historic memory"" of the holocaust.   In an interview with an Italian media outlet released on Sunday, Lavrov claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""puts forward an argument of what kind of Nazism can they have if he himself is Jewish"".  Lavrov, according to a transcript posted on the Russian foreign ministry website, then added: ""I could be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood"".  Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid labelled the comments ""an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error.""  Bennett denounced the comments as ""lies""that he said effectively ""accuse the Jews themselves of the most awful crimes in history"", perpetrated against themselves.   Russia's ambassador to Israel was summoned to ""clarify"" the remarks.   Israel has sought to tread a delicate line since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with Bennett stressing Israel's close ties to both Moscow and Kyiv.  Bennett has in particular sought to preserve Russian cooperation with Israeli strikes in Syria, where Russian forces are on the ground.   Israel has so far refused Ukraine's requests for military support, instead suppling bullet proof vests and helmets for medical workers, as well as an Israeli field hospital.  Bennett has attempted to mediate in the conflict and is among a handful of world leaders to meet with Putin since the invasion, travelling to Moscow in early March.",Politics
58,"If Roe v. Wade falls, are LGBTQ rights next?","Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion overruling Roe v. Wade, which was leaked to Politico and revealed to the public Monday night, is more than just an attack on abortion. It is a manifesto laying out a comprehensive theory of which rights are protected by the Constitution and which rights should not be enforced by the courts.  And Alito’s opinion is also a warning that, after Roe falls, the Court’s Republican majority may come for landmark LGBTQ rights decisions next, such as the marriage equality decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) or the sexual autonomy decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003).  To be clear, the leaked opinion is a draft. While Politico reports that five justices initially voted to overrule Roe, no justice’s vote is final until the Court officially hands down its decision. And even if Alito holds onto the five votes he needs to overrule Roe, one or more of his colleagues in the majority could insist that he make changes to the opinion.  Alito’s first draft, however, suggests that the archconservative justice feels emboldened. Not only does he take a maximalist approach to tearing down Roe, but much of Alito’s reasoning in the draft opinion tracks arguments he’s made in the past in dissenting opinions disparaging LGBTQ rights.  The Constitution is a frustrating document. Among other things, it contains multiple provisions stating that Americans enjoy certain civil rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the document itself. The Ninth Amendment, for example, provides that “the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”  Over time, the Supreme Court has devised multiple different standards to determine which of those unenumerated rights are nonetheless protected by our founding document. Some of these standards are very much at odds with each other.  The central thrust of Alito’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case seeking to overrule Roe, is that only rights that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” are protected. This method of weighing unenumerated rights is often referred to as the “Glucksberg” test, after the Court’s decision in Washington v. Glucksberg (1997). ",Politics

60,No magic wands for Cong. revival: Sonia,"Special Correspondent New Delhi  There are no magic wands to ensure the party’s accelerated revival except selfless work, discipline and an over-riding sense of unity and cohesion, Congress president Sonia Gandhi told the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Monday.  The CWC met to formalise the agenda of the three-day long Nav Sankalp Chintan Shivir in Udaipur from May 13. Making her opening remarks, Ms. Gandhi noted that the brainstorming meet should not be reduced to a ritual and urged her colleagues to repay their debt to the party in full measure.  Key areas  The heads of the six panels that were formed to draft discussion papers pertaining to political issues, economy, social justice, farmers, youth and organisational issues made their presentations.  A separate wing to manage elections, revival of the Parliamentary Board, regular training of workers and a cooling-off period for District and Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs were among the key discussion points. The need for ideological clarity was also discussed at the CWC meet, a source said.  Growing communal polarisation, hate campaigns against minorities, compromising the dignity of parliamentary institutions, misuse of Central agencies to target opponents, and Centre-State relations were among the key political issues that were raised.  Only bullet points on each of the six broad areas were shared by the heads of these subject committees, the source added.  A senior CWC member is said to have pointed out that a separate meet to strategise on how to effectively carry out a Jan Jagaran Abhiyan (people’s movement) should also be held on the lines of the Chintan Shivir.  ‘Repay debt to party’  The tone for the meet was set by Ms. Gandhi who stressed the point of discipline and noted that “self-criticism within party forums is needed but it should not be done in a manner that self-confidence and morale is eroded and an atmosphere of gloom and doom becomes all-pervasive”.  “There are no magic wands. It is only with selfless work, discipline and a sense of consistent collective purpose that we will demonstrate our tenacity and resilience,” Ms. Gandhi said.  “The party has been central to the life of each and every one of us. It has expected our total allegiance and has been good to each and every one of us. Now, when we are at a crucial juncture, it is imperative that we step forward and repay our debt to the party in full measure,” she added.

61,Russia is defending motherland: Putin,"Agence France-Presse Moscow  President Vladimir Putin defended Russia’s war in Ukraine as necessary to protect the “motherland” as Moscow flexed its military muscle on Monday at a huge parade marking the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.  Fierce battles raged in eastern Ukraine while Mr. Putin made his Victory Day speech against a backdrop of intercontinental ballistic missiles rumbling through Red Square.  Mr. Putin made no major announcements on Russia’s next steps but channelled Russian pride in its Second World War triumph to mobilise support for the Ukraine invasion.  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, whose forces are locked in battle with Russian troops in the east, used the occasion to say he would not allow Moscow to appropriate the Soviet Union’s triumph in Second World War.  The conflict is mired in the history between ex-Soviet neighbours Ukraine and Russia, with Mr. Putin saying the “special military operation” in Ukraine is in part to “de-Nazify” the country.  Mr. Putin blamed the West and Ukraine for today’s conflict, telling thousands of troops in Red Square that Russia faced an “absolutely unacceptable threat” and warning against the “horror of a global war”.  “You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no-one forgets the lessons of the Second World War,” he told Russian forces, shortly after intercontinental ballistic missiles rumbled through the square.  The celebration also featured 11,000 troops and more than 130 military vehicles, although a planned military flypast was cancelled.  On the ground, the key battles are being fought in Ukraine's east, which Russia is seeking to secure having tried and failed to take the capital Kyiv and the north.  The Governor of eastern Luhansk region, Sergiy Gaiday, said on Monday there were “very serious battles” around Bilogorivka and Rubizhne, as Russia tries to take the Russian-speaking Donbas. Donbas encompasses Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk.  An AFP team saw columns of trucks filled with soldiers and heavy equipment move down the main road leading away from the city of Severodonetsk, suggesting Ukraine was giving up the defence of its last stronghold in Luhansk.  Heavy shelling  Russian forces were heavily shelling the roads, while the Ukrainians were firing back to help cover the apparent pullout.  Mr. Zelensky, who spoke an hour before Mr. Putin, had invoked the ghosts of Second World War to chide Russia. “We will not allow anyone to annex this victory. We will not allow it to be appropriated,” he said.  In Kyiv, the commemoration day was largely shunned as life slowly returned to normal, weeks after fierce fighting raged in its suburbs",Politics
62,A dissonance in India-German ties,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Germany on May 2 came at a critical time, shaped by the ongoing Ukraine war. In recent times, New Delhi has been at its assertive best. Even as the United States and the European nations have applied sanctions on Moscow and provided military aid to Ukraine, New Delhi has refused to play ball. It has not only avoided condemning Moscow by abstaining in the United Nations (UN) on critical votes on the war but has also continued to engage with Moscow to increase its import of cheap crude. Its long-standing and traditional defence links with Russia remain intact. Such moves have raised eyebrows and attracted some amount of criticism from the West. New Delhi, however, insists that its position on the war is non-partisan and should be appreciated by its allies and friends.  For a nuanced stance  However, assertive media and conference statements by India’s External Affairs Minister notwithstanding, there is growing recognition in India’s strategic circles that New Delhi has to bring in more nuance to its approach with Europe. Given India’s stature, being completely isolated by the West is certainly not a best-case scenario. However, with an assertive China on the world stage and in particular, at the border with India, New Delhi needs to manage a delicate balancing act while asserting its right to pursue its national interests and strategic autonomy in foreign policy. Mr. Modi’s three-nation Europe tour (May 2-4) needs to be contextualised with these factors in the backdrop.  There is a clear, albeit delayed, move toward a unified response vis-à-vis Russia in Europe. Its significant reliance on Russian gas and crude notwithstanding, condemnation of Moscow’s moves in Ukraine is near unanimous in Europe. Not surprisingly, India’s abstention in the UN votes and its continuation of its relationship with Russia have raised quite a few hackles in Germany. In private as well as public discussions, India’s role as a major power and largest democracy are being brought to the forefront and there is a growing expectation that India needs to make a shift from its position on Russia and join hands with the European countries and the U.S. in protecting democracy in need. Amidst these expectations and pressure tactics, whether the Prime Minister’s visit to Germany helped change the perception and bridge the gap that has been growing, assumes critical importance.  Mr. Modi’s visit took place during the first term of the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Prior to Mr. Modi’s visit, the Chancellor had visited Japan, in his first visit to Asia. This is construed as a sign of Germany reaching out to other Asian powers and building on democratic alliances as an outcome of its Indo-Pacific guidelines. These two meetings had raised, albeit mistakenly, expectations among some analysts here in Germany of a democratic dividend that may lead to a convergence of views and possibly policies on Russia between the two countries. As proved by the Ukraine war, however, New Delhi has chosen to prioritise its interests over pursuing a policy that is shaped by common democratic values that define Germany, Japan and India.  The China factor  In fact, for several years now, Indian policies have resisted promoting democracy in the neighbourhood and have instead opted to deal with de facto powers. Afghanistan, where India is still reluctant to do business with the Taliban, is probably an aberration. On the other hand, India’s policy towards Myanmar’s junta is defined by this pragmatism. Therefore, the democratic rationale of a convergence of interests to protect democratic values is hardly a strong binding chord between India and Germany. The geopolitical convergence of countering the rise of China particularly in the Indo-Pacific seems to be a more compelling necessity rather than the ideational and normative aspects of protecting democratic norms and values.  Engagement with Europe  New Delhi’s objective is multifaceted as far its relations with Europe in general and Germany in particular is concerned. So far, it has not revised its position on Russia and Ukraine, by continuing to underline its unequivocal condemnation of the violence. However, unlike the West, India makes it clear that irrespective of its position on a solitary issue of geopolitical relevance, which the former may find difficult to reconcile with, the bilateral engagement with countries such as Germany, France and Denmark remains at the top of its priority. The purpose of such a policy is clearly to present itself as not being isolated but as a swing power that can move deftly on the geopolitical and diplomatic chessboard.  Towards this direction, the holding of the sixth India-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations (IGC), a biennial format which India conducts with Germany, assumed critical importance. India attaches significant importance to the ‘long-standing commercial ties’ with Germany, an important pillar of the ‘Strategic Partnership’, which the two nations entered into in 2000. The idea, therefore, is to highlight a convergence of issues of economics, technology and climate change (low hanging fruits), in spite of the intensifying dissonance on democratic and strategic issues. That remains the crux of the Indian approach.  Room for full ties  It remains a fact that India-Germany relations have yet to achieve their full potential. One of the factors for that, possibly, is the lack of understanding of each other’s strategic cultures and domestic politics. It is doubtful that Mr. Modi’s visit changed any of that, particularly in the absence of any media interaction and strategic communication. Germany has invited Mr. Modi to the G-7 meeting in June this year, construed as a bid to wean India away from its position on Russia. However, while the attempt may not be successful, it is certainly a pointer to the emerging multipolarity in the international system, which provides space for major powers such as Germany and India to play a greater role in bringing peace and stability in other theatres, particularly in Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific. In times of shifting geopolitical alliances and realignments, India and Germany can emerge as important poles in shaping the new world order.

His remarks came on the heels of Pakistan Army warning its critics to avoid throwing dirt on the premier institution as it took “strong exception” to “intensified and deliberate attempts” to drag it into politics after the removal of Mr. Khan-led government last month.  Mr. Khan had told his audience that Siraj ud-Daula was the Governor of Bengal appointed by the Mughal Emperor and his commander-in-chief, Mir Jaffar, joined hands with the English to topple Daula’s government. In the same vein, the former premier alleged his government was toppled by “the Mir Jafars and Mir Sadiqs of today”.",Politics
65,‘China’s intent is to keep boundary issue alive’,"Dinakar Peri NEW DELHI  The basic issue with China remains resolution of the border and what is seen is China’s intent to keep “the boundary issue alive”, according to Army chief Gen. Manoj Pande. In eastern Ladakh, India’s aim and intention, as far as the situation is concerned, is to restore the status quo ante prior to April 2020, he said in an interaction with a group of journalists on Monday.  On the impact of the Ukraine war, he observed that the foremost one was the relevance of conventional wars still remained and they need not necessarily be short and swift. He acknowledged that the Army’s supply chains were impacted to “some extent” but asserted that there was sufficient stock to last for a “reasonable” period of time.  “The first and foremost challenge is the resolution of the situations along the borders prevailing since April/May 2020. Our aim and intention as far as the situation is concerned is to restore the status quo ante prior to April 2020 in eastern Ladakh. Our intention is also re-establish the trust and tranquillity on both sides,” Gen. Pande said. “It cannot be a one-way affair. Efforts should be made from the sides.”  On relations with China, he said the basic issue remained the resolution of the border matter. “What we see is that China’s intent has been to keep the boundary issue alive. What we need as a country is a ‘whole of nation’ approach and in the military domain, this is to prevent and counter any attempt to alter the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).”  Important lessons  To a question from The Hindu on the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war on the Indian Army’s preparedness, he stated that it had important lessons. The foremost was that the relevance of a conventional war still remained. “We are seeing many platforms — artillery guns, air defence guns, rockets, missiles and tanks being employed in this war in one way or the other. It also tells us that wars need not be necessarily be short and swift. It could prolong in a manner the current conflict is.”  The second important lesson would be to try and be self-reliant in terms of weapons, armaments, equipment and spares from outside. “We are dependent on certain weapon systems specially in the area of air defence, rockets, missiles and certain tanks from Russia and Ukraine,” he noted. Increasing the self-reliance and decreasing the dependence on outside sources was an important lesson. “We have already started this, in keeping with the Make in India initiative as also to attain ‘Aatmanirbharta’,” he explained.  As far as the immediate impact was concerned, he said, “the supply chain of certain spares and ammunition has got impacted to some extent, but we have adequate stocks to last for a reasonable period of time.” They were also looking at certain alternative mitigation measures and identifying alternative sources from friendly foreign countries, while in the long term, this was also an opportunity for the private industry to step up production and meet the requirements.  The third important issue was the aspect of non-contact or non-kinetic warfare and the lesson had come out “loud and clear”. Elaborating, he asserted that “be it the cyber domain or information domain, we have seen the battle of narratives has been used to gain advantage over the adversary. We need to increasingly focus on the new domains of warfare, focus on capability development.”  In the broader scenario, Gen. Pande said, the emerging geopolitical order was something that should be monitored very closely in terms of realignment and in terms of new alliances. That was something which would perhaps be much clear once the conflict ended.  On the situation in eastern Ladakh, he pointed out that through dialogue at the Corps Commander level between the two countries “many friction areas have been resolved after talking to each other” and the balance areas could “only be resolved through dialogue”.  “It is good that we are talking to and engaging with each other. Our troops continue to hold important positions along the LAC,” he stressed. The guidance to the troops was to “have a firm and resolute” posture to “prevent any efforts to alter the status quo.”  The Army had reoriented its troops from the west to the northern borders since the stand-off. There was a “re-appraisal and re-assessment” of the preparedness. “We have a ‘robust posture’ on the LAC and ‘adequate forces to deal with all contingencies’.”  In this direction, he said, the Army had to remain prepared to face a variety of challenges on the entire spectrum.",Politics
66,Akhilesh demands HC-monitored probe into Chandauli woman’s death,"Omar RashidLUCKNOW  Stating that he does not trust the Uttar Pradesh police investigation, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday demanded that a sitting High Court judge-monitored probe be conducted into the death of a woman in Chandauli during a police raid at her house.  He also demanded that the police team be booked for murder.  On May 1, a police team had reached Manrajpur village under the Sayedraja police station jurisdiction in search of Kanhaiya Yadav, an accused under the Gangsters Act, with a non-bailable warrant. The police team was accused of beating to death his daughter Nisha.  Subsequently, an FIR was registered against the Station House Officer and other police personnel for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt and house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint.  While the police had initially said prima facie it was a case of suicide, the cause of death remained unclear after the autopsy. The viscera was sent for forensic examination.  Mr. Yadav reached Chandauli and met the aggrieved family. “The police can cook up any story and can twist it the way they like,” he said.  He demanded that not only the girl’s family be provided security, but the probe be conducted under the supervision of a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court. “We don’t trust the government probe. This government can do anything and can change any report,” he told journalists. Mr. Yadav also accused the U.P. police of indulging in “dabangai (high-handedness)”.  ‘Concocting stories’  “First they lodged cases against their father and expelled him from the district under political pressure,” Mr. Yadav said, referring to the police raid at Kanhaiya Yadav’s home.  He also demanded that the police team be booked for murder. While the family of the woman, who was in her early twenties, had accused the police team of murder, a case was registered against the personnel for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The local SHO was suspended.  Mr. Yadav did not believe the police theory that the woman took her own life in the house during the raid. “U.P. police are ahead in concocting stories,” said the former U.P. Chief Minister.

67,Puja at Kashmir temple stokes controversy,"Special Correspondent SRINAGAR  A religious event chaired by Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday at the 8th Century protected site of Martand Temple in south Kashmir’s Anantnag has landed in a controversy as the  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) denied that it had issued any permission for holding puja at the core protected area on the premises.  Mr. Sinha on Sunday took part in the Navgrah Ashtamangalam puja at the ancient Martand Sun Temple in Mattan, Anantnag. The event saw the presence of saints, members of Kashmiri Pandit community and local residents, according to Raj Bhawan. Later, the L-G termed the event a truly divine experience.  “We are making dedicated efforts to transform historical spiritual places of J&K into vibrant centres that will guide us on the path of righteousness and bless this beautiful land with peace, happiness and prosperity,” the L-G said after the puja.  The ASI officials told The Hindu that the department was alerted about the visit of the L-G but “no permission was sought for puja” at the protected site.  The ASI does not allow religious events at protected monuments except the customary prayers that were being held prior to the ASI takeover. It was for the first time that a puja of this scale was held within 200 metres of the core protected site, said another ASI official.  “This will set a precedent for other protected monuments in Kashmir,” a senior ex-ASI official said.",Politics
68,Gokulam on the cusp of history,"Amitabha Das Sharma KOLKATA  Football in Kerala is riding the crest of fortune. After the state team won the Santosh Trophy barely a week ago, it is now the turn for Gokulam Kerala FC to take the I-League title back home and restart the celebrations.  The Malabarians have definitely held out the strong footballing tradition of the state in its performance while outgunning every opposition in the list to remain unbeaten for a record 16 matches and etch out a six-point lead on top of the current standings.  With just two rounds to go, a point from the penultimate match against Sreenidi Deccan FC on Tuesday will be enough to see Gokulam FC (on 40 points) retain the crown and become the first team in the 15-year history of the I-League to win back-to-back titles. The last team to attain something similar was the former Goa side Dempo SC but its feat is considered partial owing to a nomenclature problem.  Dempo won the National Football League in 2006-07 season and when it won the title again next season, the tournament’s name was changed to I-League.  Interestingly, the title can go Gokulam Kerala’s way even before it starts against Sreenidi Deccan, if second placed Mohammedan Sporting (on 34 points from 16) fails to win its match against Rajasthan United FC.  Gokulam Kerala coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese wished to wrap up the issue in the next outing but remained wary of the opponent which, he felt, had the knack for upstaging bigger opponents.  Tough task  “We know the importance of the game and have to put out our best to get the result in our favour. It is a tough task as the opponents always apply extra power when they are playing against the leader,” said Vincenzo Alberto. “I want my players to believe in their abilities like they have done in the previous matches.  “And if we stick to our plan then we can easily win the needed points,” he added.",Sports

I still believe that I make some big results, maybe not now, but in a few months.”  The crowd cheered warmly as the three-time Grand Slam winner completed victory over the World No. 17 Opelka, a semifinalist here last year, in just over two hours.  “It feels great because I was away from tennis for so much time,” he said. “I did a lot of hard work to come back, so it feels great to finally win a match, to see that things are getting better.”  Important results (first round):  Men: Wawrinka bt Opelka 3-6, 7-5, 6-2; Shapovalov bt Sonego 7-6(5), 3-6, 6-3.

The Olympics bronze medallist from India executed her tactics well to emerge the winner in a tough bout featuring two 24-year-olds.  The taller Lovlina used her long reach well and moved in and out to land some solid punches on Chen and take the first round by a split verdict.  As the Taipei boxer stepped up the attack in the second round, Lovlina responded by maintaining the tempo of her game. The Indian kept herself out of Chen’s reach, battling from a safe distance and taking the upper hand in the third round.  In her first outing after the Tokyo Olympics in July last year, Lovlina — a two-time Worlds bronze medallist — met an opponent against whom she had a 1-2 head-to-head record.

Curry also dished out eight assists and grabbed five rebounds as Golden State rallied to win without coach Steve Kerr after he tested positive for COVID-19 less than two hours before tipoff.  Curry took charge just like he has so many times on the playoff stage and now his Warriors are one win from a trip to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2019. He tied it at 90 on a fall-away baseline jumper with 3:25 to go and his two free throws with 45.7 seconds to go gave the Warriors a 94-93 lead, their first of the night.  Tyus Jones had 19 points, six rebounds and five assists as Memphis missed injured All-Star Ja Morant. Dillon Brooks returned from a one-game suspension and struggled mightily, missing a 3-point try with 53 seconds left and finishing 5 for 19 with 12 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Andrew Wiggins had 17 points and 10 rebounds and Klay Thompson scored 14 points despite missing all seven of his 3-point attempts for the cold-shooting Warriors, who didn't have to contend with do-everything Morant this time. The Grizzlies guard missed the game with soreness in his right knee after Jordan Poole grabbed him while going for a loose ball late in Game 3 — leading Morant and Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins to question Poole’s intentions.  It remained unclear whether Morant would be back for Game 5 on Wednesday in Memphis.  Brooks sat out Game 3 as a penalty by the league for his Flagrant 2 foul that injured Gary Payton II in Game 2, when Brooks hit the Golden State guard over the head on a driving layup attempt and Payton fell hard and broke his left elbow. Kerr called it a “dirty” play and said Brooks had broken an NBA code of conduct.  Brooks was booed nearly every time he touched the ball, fouled or when he checked back into the game.  Golden State trailed 69-62 going into the fourth quarter after Desmond Bane's 32-foot 3-pointer beat the third-quarter buzzer. However, both teams struggled all night to make their 3s.  Kerr was replaced by associate head coach Mike Brown, who agreed Sunday to become the Sacramento Kings new coach after this postseason run.  Poole scored 14 off the bench for the Warriors as they survived a nail-biter following a postseason-record point total in Saturday's 142-112 Game 3 blowout.

Exhausting race  In a physically exhausting race for the drivers and teams at the Miami International Autodrome, the 24-year-old Dutchman produced a mature performance.  His second successive win and third of the season enabled him to trim Leclerc’s advantage to 19 points in the drivers’ championship. Leclerc has 104 and Verstappen 85. It was the 23rd win of the Dutchman’s career.  Verstappen came home 3.786s ahead of Leclerc with Carlos Sainz third in the second Ferrari after holding off a late charge from Sergio Perez.  George Russell finished fifth after recovering from 15th on the opening lap to come home ahead of Mercedes teammate and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton.  In a tactical race of attrition and many minor incidents, Russell made the most of a late Safety Car intervention when McLaren’s Lando Norris collided with Pierre Gasly’s Alpha Tauri to take a ‘free’ pit stop for new tyres.  The final 10 laps produced more action than the previous 47 including another accident when Mick Schumacher of Haas collided with fellow German and four-time champion Sebastian Vettel’s Aston Martin.

82,Bumrah special not enough as Knight Riders beat Mumbai Indians,"Abhishek Mukherjee NAVI MUMBAI  Jasprit Bumrah’s fiery spell went in vain as Kolkata Knight Riders put up a disciplined effort with the ball to successfully defend 165 and register a 52-run win at the D.Y. Patil Stadium here on Monday. Pat Cummins (three for 22), Andre Russell (two for 22) and Tim Southee (one for 10) bowled probing spells and reaped rewards to keep Shreyas Iyer’s men in the hunt for the playoffs.  After being stunned by Bumrah during the business-end of their innings, Knight Riders came back strongly to chip away at the opposition.  Rohit Sharma fell in the first over, caught behind off Southee. Tilak Varma and Ramandeep Singh perished while trying ambitious shots off Andre Russell; Tim David, after a fiesty start with boundaries off the first three balls he faced, top-edged when attempting to smash Varun Chakravarthy out of the park.  Ishan Kishan (51, 43b, 5x4, 1x6), however, was in full flow at the other end. Playing the ball on its merit, he found the odd boundary through sweetly-timed drives in the ‘V’. When he, too, couldn’t resist the fatal pull shot, Knight Riders were well and truly on top. Cummins took two more in the same over, both off short deliveries. Poor running by the Mumbai Indians lower-order hastened the end.  That Mumbai Indians had a fighting chance at the halfway stage was mainly due to an excellent bowling performance from Bumrah. Unsettling the batters with yorkers and short deliveries, Bumrah claimed his maiden five-wicket haul (five for 10) in the IPL as Knight Riders lost their way after a bright start. The last six wickets fell for 28 runs. Venkatesh Iyer (43, 24b, 3x4, 4x6), returning to the side after sitting out the last two games, helped the team post its highest total in the PowerPlay this season — 64 — before Nitish Rana (43, 26b, 3x4, 4x6) took the baton from him and kept the boundaries coming.  Bumrah changed the complexion of the game in the 15th over, softening up Russell with a sharp yorker before testing him with a short delivery. Russell went for the pull but holed out to the fielder at long-on.  Rana fell in the same over, undecided whether to duck or fend a short ball and gloving the ball to the wicketkeeper. In Bumrah’s next over, Sheldon Jackson, Cummins and Sunil Narine all perished to quick deliveries. Mumbai Indians got a taste of its own medicine when it batted.",Sports

85,GT vs MI IPL 2022: How Hardik Pandya planned dismissal of former teammate Kieron Pollard,"Gujarat Titans captain Hardik Pandya has been on the money in IPL 2022. His decision making on the go has been on point so far.   And Match 51 between GT and Mumbai Indians was no different.   After MI openers Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan got the team to a quick start, Hardik was smart enough to pull things back with his tactical moves.   One of the smartest moves on the night was when Ishan Kishan fell for 45 off 29 balls.  His former MI teammate Kieron Pollard came to bat at No 5 and Hardik brought back Rashid Khan instantly.   Pollard has had issues with Rashid and it was telling again when the big West Indian began to struggle against the turn and guile of Afghan bowler.  Rashid bowled four back to back dots and then Pollard attempted to play a cover drive, but he misread the line and the ball kissed the stumps.   That was a smart move frm Hardik, who has spent many a seasons with Mumbai Indians and knows a thing of two about Pollard's batting. ",Sports

88,Asian Games 2022 postponed amid COVID surge in China: OCA,"TASHKENT/BEIJING: The Hangzhou Asian Games, which were scheduled to take place from September 10 to 25, were on Friday postponed indefinitely amid a recent surge in COVID-19 cases in China. The new dates will be announced in near future. An air of uncertainty was hovering over the 19th edition of the multi-sports Games ever since Shanghai came under a fresh wave of the pandemic, forcing a lockdown in the city. The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) Executive Board met in Tashkent on Friday to discuss the situation and felt postponing the Games was the best decision under the circumstances.  ""Following detailed discussions with the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) and the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee (HAGOC), the OCA Executive Board (EB) today decided to postpone the 19th Asian Games, which were scheduled to be held in Hangzhou, China, from 10 to 25 September 2022,"" the OCA said in a statement, posted on its website. ""The new dates of the 19th Asian Games will be agreed between the OCA, the COC and the HAGOC and announced in the near future,"" the statement added. The OCA said the HAGOC was well prepared to deliver the Games on time despite global challenges. However, after carefully considering the pandemic situation and the magnitude of the Games, the decision was taken by all the stakeholders. The name and the emblem of the 19th Asian Games will remain unchanged, and the OCA believes that the Games will achieve complete success through the joint efforts of all parties. About 11,000 athletes were to compete in 61 sporting disciplines in the Games. The development comes at a time when China is battling a record number of daily cases in Shanghai, which is only a short train ride away from Games host city Hangzhou. Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, is some 175 kilometres southwest of Shanghai. As per the latest update, Zhejiang has recorded 3124 positive cases and one death. Additionally, the 3rd Asian Youth Games, which was scheduled from December 20-28 in Shantou, China have also been cancelled.

91,The search algorithm in action,"THE GIST  An algorithm, essentially, is a series of instructions. Tech giant Alphabet Inc’s Google, whose flagship product is the Google search engine, is the dominant player in the search market.  Algorithms are often built using historical data and for specific functions. Once developed, they go through frequent updates from companies for quality enhancement. Any changes or updates in their algorithms could also mean that traffic is steered away from certain sites and businesses, which could have a negative effect on their revenue.  Firms can use these algorithms to change the way they rank products on websites, prioritising their own products and excluding competitors. Some of these concerns have caught the eye of regulators.  Ishan Patra  The story so far: Algorithms play a crucial role for search engines as they process millions of web searches every day. With the quantity of information available on the internet growing steadily, search algorithms are becoming increasingly complex, raising privacy and other concerns and drawing the attention of regulators. Last month, U.K.’s digital watchdog said they will take a closer look at algorithms, seeking views on the benefits and risks of how sites and apps use algorithms, as well as inputs on auditing algorithms, the current landscape and the role of regulators.  How do search algorithms work?  An algorithm, essentially, is a series of instructions. It can be used to perform a calculation, find answers to a question or solve a problem. Search engines use a number of algorithms to perform different functions prior to displaying relevant results to an individual’s search request.  Tech giant Alphabet Inc’s Google, whose flagship product is the Google search engine, is the dominant player in the search market. Its search engine provides results to consumers with the help of its ranking systems, which are composed of a broad set of algorithms, that sort through web pages in its search index to find the most appropriate results in quick time. Its search algorithms consider several factors, including the words and expressions of a user’s query, relevance and usability of pages, expertise of sources, and the user’s location and settings, according to the firm.  While Google captures a significant chunk of the general search market, there are alternative search engines such as Microsoft’s Bing and DuckDuckGo available for users to explore. The latter, a privacy-focused search engine, claims it does not collect or share users’ personal information.  In January, market leader Google generated 61.4% of all core search queries in the U.S., according to database company Statista. During the same period of time, Microsoft sites handled a quarter of all search queries in the U.S.  As the algorithms used to deliver results would vary from one search engine to another, when a user inputs a query, the results would also differ. Moreover, results from different users would be rarely similar, even when searching for the same things, since the algorithms take into account multiple factors, like their location.  How are they developed?  Algorithms are often built using historical data and for specific functions. Once developed, they go through frequent updates from the companies to enhance the quality of search engine results presented to users. Most large search engine providers also bank on machine learning to automatically improve their users’ search experience, essentially by identifying patterns in previous decisions to make future ones.  Over the years, Google has developed search algorithms and updated them constantly, with some major updates like Panda, Penguin, Hummingbird, RankBrain, Medic, Pigeon, and Payday, meant to enhance some function or address some issue. In March, it introduced another update to improve the search engine’s ability to identify high-quality product reviews.  Search engines exert huge control over which sites consumers can find. Any changes or updates in their algorithms could also mean that traffic is steered away from certain sites and businesses, which could have a negative effect on their revenue.  What are the concerns?  The search giant’s trackers have allegedly been found on majority of the top million websites, as per a DuckDuckGo blog post. “This means they are not only tracking what you search for, [but] they’re also tracking which websites you visit, and using all your data for ads that follow you around the internet,” it added.  According to a Council of Europe study, the use of data from profiles, including those established based on data collected by search algorithms and search engines, directly affects the right to a person’s informational self-determination. Most of Google’s revenues stem from advertisements, such as those it shows consumers in response to a search query.  DuckDuckGo, in addition to providing an alternative to Google’s search engine, offers mobile apps and desktop browser extensions to protect users’ privacy while browsing the web. The privacy-focused firm, in a blog post, said that editorialised results, informed by the personal information Google has on people (like their search, browsing, and purchase history), puts them in a “Filter Bubble” based on what Google’s algorithms think they are most likely to click on.  What’s the current state of these algorithms?  These search algorithms can be used to personalise services in ways that are difficult to detect, leading to search results that can be manipulated to reduce choice or artificially change consumers’ perceptions.  Additionally, firms can also use these algorithms to change the way they rank products on websites, prioritising their own products and excluding competitors. Some of these concerns have caught the eye of regulators and as a result these search algorithms have come under their scrutiny.  The European Commission has fined Google €2.42 billion for abusing its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison-shopping service.  Moreover, under the Commission’s proposal on the Digital Services Act, transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including the algorithms used for recommending content or products to users are expected to come into force.  “Majority of algorithms used by private firms online are currently subject to little or no regulatory oversight,” U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority has said earlier in a statement, adding that “more monitoring and action is required by regulators.”",Tech
