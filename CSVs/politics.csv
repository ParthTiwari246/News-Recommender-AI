48,Marcos Jr. leads in Philippines elections,"Agence France-Presse Manila  The son of late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos on Tuesday headed for a historic landslide victory in the country’s presidential election, after Filipinos brushed aside warnings about weakening of their already fragile democracy.  Nearly 40 years after his namesake father was deposed by a popular revolt and his family chased into exile, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had garnered more than double the number of votes of his nearest rival, according to an unofficial tally of results.  With more than 84% of precincts reporting, Mr. Marcos had received over 27 million votes against liberal candidate Leni Robredo’s 12.9 million.  If sustained, the tally — published by local media from Commission on Elections figures — would make Mr. Marcos the first Philippine President since his father’s ouster to be elected with an absolute majority.  Historic turnaround  It would also signal an astonishing turnaround for the fortunes of the Marcos clan, who have come from being pariahs to in reach of the presidential palace in a generation.  Mr. Marcos’ campaign was marked by a relentless online whitewashing of his father’s brutal and corrupt regime, as well as an embrace of current authoritarian President Rodrigo Duterte, who retains widespread popular support.  Before polling day, rights activists, Catholic leaders and political analysts had warned Mr. Marcos could rule with an even heavier fist if he wins by a large margin.  Delivering a late-night address from his campaign headquarters in Manila, a tired but beaming Mr. Marcos thanked volunteers for months of “sacrifices and work”. But he stopped short of claiming victory, warning that “the count is not yet done”.  “Let’s wait until it’s very clear, until the count reaches a hundred percent then we can celebrate.”",Politics
49,"BJP Leader's Arrest: Punjab Cops Stopped In Haryana, Kidnap Case In Delhi","New Delhi: Delhi BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga was arrested on Friday morning from his Delhi residence by the Punjab police on charges of making provocative statements, promoting religious enmity, and criminal intimidation. The Punjab police team taking Mr Bagga to Mohali was stopped en route by Haryana cops after the Delhi police registered a kidnapping case based on a complaint by Mr Bagga's father.   In a video statement, Delhi BJP spokesperson Naveen Kumar Jindal claimed around 50 cops barged into Mr Bagga's Delhi home at around 8:30 in the morning and arrested him. ""He couldn't even wear his turban,"" he said.  Mr Bagga's father has claimed that he was punched in the face when he attempted to capture the incident on video. Talking to news agency ANI, he said, ""This morning, 10-15 police personnel came to our home and dragged Tajinder out. When I picked up my mobile phone to record a video of the incident, police took me to another room and punched me in the face.""  The Punjab police say they had sent notice to Mr Bagga five times to join the investigation but he refused to comply.   Mr Bagga will now be taken to a Punjab court after legal action in Delhi. The complaint was registered with the cyber cell at Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar in Punjab's Mohali district.  Mr Bagga has been very vocal against Arvind Kejriwal on social media. He came under fire from the AAP, which is ruling both Delhi and Punjab, for his tweet against Mr Kejriwal over 'The Kashmir Files' movie.",Politics
50,"""Was Hit 30 To 35 Times"": Hyderabad Woman On Husband's Murder In Public","Hyderabad: Her husband was beaten to death with an iron road on a busy road in Hyderabad and a crowd couldn't save him, though she begged for help. Syed Ashrin Sulthana later told the police the killers were her brother and his friends. She wants them brought to justice. Newlywed Sulthana entered her husband B Nagaraju's home for the first time after his death two days ago. She says she will live in his childhood home, with his memories, till the day she dies.  Nagaraju, a Hindu, died instantly after the attack by his Muslim wife's brother.  Dazed with grief, Sulthana, 21, holds tight to a framed photo of Nagaraju as Lord Krishna as she speaks to NDTV on the horror of Wednesday evening.  ""My husband and I were going on a bike. He slowed down a little to cross the road, suddenly two bikes came. I didn't realise my brother was on one of them. They pushed my husband, he fell. They started hitting him with rods. When I tried to save him, my brother's friends pushed me. I pleaded for help but people took videos,"" she said.  It was all over within moments, but she felt people had enough time to intervene and stop the attack. She feels she wasted precious seconds asking for help that never came.  ""In 10 to 15 minutes, my husband was hit 30 to 35 times with a rod. They hit my husband on his brain.  When he died and when I touched his head, my hand went right through... his brain had spilled out. I wasted my time asking people for help, trusting society. I could have used that time to do something more to help my husband. My husband didn't even realise my brother killed him... Twenty people could have stopped four people.""  Nagaraju, a 25-year-old car salesman, and Sulthana, married on January 31, defying her family, which was rabidly opposed to her marrying outside her faith.  But the two had known each other since school and were madly in love. Their love, they felt, would prevail and win. Religion had never bothered them before.  ""There was always a threat from my family. I had told Raju to marry someone else as there was a problem. I tried to persuade him for two months. But he said we will live together and die together. Even if we have to go somewhere far away after marriage. He said I am ready to die for you. Today, my husband did end up dying, because of me. I feel if I had let him marry someone else, he would have lived,"" Sulthana shared.  ""Being here, in Raju's childhood home, I feel like I am with him.""  Her mother-in-law presses her to drink her juice and she does, reluctantly -  two women, united in grief.  Sulthana cannot get the gruesome images out of her mind - her husband lying lifeless on the road, his head a mess of blood, flesh and bits of brain.  In the 10 years she had known Nagaraju, Sulthana had never seen him in pain. Yet she saw him die in the most horrific way.  ""I thought I couldn't even survive one minute without my husband. But I am here, talking to you, because I am angry with my brother. All I want is that they suffer for how my husband died,"" she said.  ""My brother beat me the day before my wedding, on January 30. He locked me in a room and told me to hang myself.""",Politics
51,"Amid rising violence, Mahinda Rajapaksa quits as Sri Lanka PM","Meera Srinivasan COLOMBO  Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned on Monday, his office said, hours after his supporters brutally assaulted peaceful anti-government protesters amid a worsening economic crisis in the island.  The resignation was accepted, according to a gazette notification, and consequently, the Cabinet stands dissolved as per the Sri Lankan Constitution.  Three persons died outside the capital in ensuing clashes, while at least 150 were injured in Colombo. Government MP Amarakeerthi Athukorala reportedly shot two persons and then himself after being surrounded by a mob in the neighbouring Gampaha district, the police told AFP. Homes of several ruling party lawmakers were torched, while some among anti-government protesters assaulted government supporters who turned up in Colombo, amid escalating violence on the streets.  An AFP reporter said shots were fired from inside the Sri Lankan Prime Minister’s official residence Temple Trees, as thousands of protesters breached the main gate and torched a truck at the entrance. The police also fired tear gas to push back protesters retaliating against an attack on them earlier in the day by those loyal to Mr. Mahinda.  Police sources confirmed that shots were fired in the air to prevent the crowd breaching the inner security ring of the residence where Mr. Mahinda was holed up.",Politics
52,Shaheen Bagh residents see ‘divisive agenda’ behind drive,"Samridhi Tewari NEW DELHI  Syed Farhan, a Shaheen Bagh resident, observed the lone bulldozer brought by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to his locality on Monday morning with great interest. “For a long time, the officials stood beside the bulldozer trying to spot an encroachment,” Farhan told The Hindu.  “After a few hours, the officials directed the bulldozer towards a temporary scaffolding. However, before the officials could take any action, many locals came forward and removed it themselves. Following this, the SDMC people left the spot.”  While the South civic body ended up not carrying out any ‘anti-encroachment’ activity, which was part of the “massive demolition campaign” promised by Mayor Mukesh Suryan last month, the presence of police personnel and a bulldozer ended up infuriating several residents here who saw a “divisive agenda” at play behind the entire exercise. Many of them protested against the drive.  “In a city like Delhi, it is common for municipalities to go after makeshift stalls and for the vendors to pack up and flee. But what is worrying is the manner in which specific areas and communities are being targeted,” said Mohammad Abuzar Chaudhary, a social activist and local resident. He added that the anti-encroachment drives were creating an environment of fear among poor Muslim families living in these areas.   A senior SDMC official said they did not find any temporary stalls in Shaheen Bagh causing obstruction in traffic movement.   “We wanted to remove these encroachments but the stall owners had already cleared them. During the drive, we noticed that a building had a scaffolding which was disrupting the right of way. It had to be removed as per protocol. This is a routine exercise, we were not trying to disrupt the peace in the area,” said the senior SDMC official.  One resident spoke in favour of the drive, arguing that makeshift stalls in the area were indeed obstructing movement.  “The residents of the area have no role to play as the vendors are from different areas. The vendors keep putting up their stalls wherever they wish and keep changing their locations,” said Syed Shamsher Alam.",Politics
53,"Biden Wants Ukraine Aid Passed Immediately, Separate From COVID-19 Funding","Democrats initially wanted to pair the aid packages together to ensure passage of both. The shift means Ukraine aid will likely move forward, but the fate of pandemic relief is uncertain.  President Joe Biden is shifting strategy with additional aid for Ukraine and more COVID-19 funding languishing for weeks: Pass them separately and prioritize emergency funds to counter the Russian invasion in order to avoid further delays.  The move is almost certain to ensure that tens of billions of dollars in new military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine will pass in the near future. Like the last round of aid approved in March, there’s overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress for additional help for Ukraine as it enters the third month of Russia’s invasion. Biden urged swift passage, warning that he’s already “nearly exhausted” the previous funding of nearly $14 billion.  Late last month, Biden requested another $33 billion, and after conversations with leadership, he said in a statement he expects Congress will “likely to pass it in substantially the form I proposed.” The fate, however, of additional funding to restore the federal government’s coronavirus testing, vaccine and therapeutics capacity is much more unpredictable and could face significant roadblocks once again from Republicans and perhaps even some Democrats. As he proposed new Ukrainian aid, Biden reiterated his call for $22.5 billion in pandemic relief, though senators instead struck a much more slimmed down $10 billion bipartisan deal last month.  “I have been informed by Congressional leaders in both parties that such an addition would slow down action on the urgently needed Ukrainian aid – a view expressed strongly by several Congressional Republicans,” Biden said in a Monday statement. “Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away.”  “However let me be clear: as vital as it is to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat COVID,” he added. “So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days. And then, I urge Congress to move promptly on the COVID funding bill.”  Coronavirus funding, specifically, has been tied up in Congress for weeks. The Senate failed to advance the $10 billion in funding in early April after Republicans blocked the procedural vote. As a part of the bill, they wanted an amendment vote on delaying the end of Title 42, the public health order implemented by the Trump administration in 2020 allowing the expulsion of migrants who cross the border because of pandemic concerns.  Since Biden’s announcement that he’d wind down Title 42 on May 23, Republicans and a growing number of Democrats – moderates and ones facing tough reelection races in November – have been seeking a delay and want a detailed plan from the administration if there’s an influx of migrants at the border once it lifts. The plan, however, could be put on hold after a federal judge in Louisiana issued a temporary restraining order against reversing Title 42 before the May deadline.  Democrats were initially angling to pair the Ukraine and COVID-19 funding to ensure the latter passed and dare Republicans to vote against financial help for the eastern European country. Leadership and Biden saw that as the best chance to get pandemic aid through.  But now that the president wants to unlink them and pass Ukraine aid first, Democrats will now need to confront more political hurdles. If Republicans keep up their demands for a vote on Title 42 as part of any coronavirus funding, Democrats will need to decide whether to budge.  With a split 50-50 Senate, both aid packages will need to secure some Republican support in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to avoid the threat of a filibuster. While it seems very likely there will be more than 10 GOP votes for the Ukraine aid, the same isn’t certain for the other.",Politics
54,Anti-encroachment drive stalled in Delhi,"Krishnadas Rajagopal Muneef Khan New Delhi  The national capital witnessed another round of ‘bulldozer politics’ on Monday after the BJP-ruled South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) scheduled an anti-encroachment drive at Shaheen Bagh, the epicentre of a three-month-long agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act beginning December 2019.  While the Supreme Court, unlike the previous instance when the North Delhi Municipal Corporation carried out demolitions in Jahangirpuri last month, refused to intervene or stay the exercise on a petition by the CPI(M)’s Delhi unit, the drive was halted due to stiff resistance from residents of Shaheen Bagh as hundreds of people gathered on the streets and atop buildings.  ‘Found already removed’  A senior SDMC official also said the encroachments that were previously found along the stretch were found to be “already removed”.",Politics

Mr Jaishankar made the remarks while addressing the gathering here for the celebration of 74 years of independence of Israel.  ""When I look back at our relationship, in the last several years that I have been associated with, for me the goosebumps moment in a way was at Tel Aviv when the PM visited Israel in July 2017, first Indian PM to visit Israel. And, since then our relationship has really taken off,"" the EAM said.  Mr Jaishankar said that both the countries are focussing on expanding the knowledge-based relationship which includes cooperation in innovation and research. He further said that Israel is an integral part of the 'Make in India' initiatives.  Talking about the future prospects, Mr Jaishankar mentioned, ""As I see the future of this relationship for me one of the most encouraging signs is intellectual, students in huge numbers are going from here to there, research project we are doing.""  Mr Jaishankar also touched upon the aspect of the new Quad consisting of India, Israel, UAE, and the US, where he hoped this group can play an important role in expanding economic cooperation in that region.  Israel's envoy to India, Sri Lanka and Bhutan Naor Gilon appreciated Jaishnakar's presence on the occasion of Israel's 74th Independence Day, and also on 30 years of diplomatic relations between India and Israel.  ""I've to quote our Guest of Honour who during his visit to Israel last October said that relations between us didn't start 30 years ago. It's a connection between very old civilizations which is probably the basis for very healthy bilateral relations, the two modern countries are having,"" Gilon said in his speech.  ""This occasion is particularly special for us as we're celebrating 30 years of our full diplomatic relations between India and Israel. We're also celebrating 75 years of our own independence and these significant milestones help us together to look at horizons of our expanding relationships,"" he added.

57,Vladimir Putin Apologised For Russia Hitler Claims: Israel PM's Office,"Jerusalem, Undefined: Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Thursday that Russian leader Vladimir Putin has apologised for remarks made by Moscow's top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, who claimed Adolf Hitler may have had ""Jewish blood"".  The comments had sparked outrage in the Jewish state.  ""The Prime Minister accepted President Putin's apology for Lavrov's remarks and thanked him for clarifying his attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust,"" Bennett's office said in a statement.   A Kremlin summary of the Bennett-Putin call, which came as Israel marked 74 years since the creation of the Jewish state, made no mention of a Putin apology.   It did, however, note that the leaders discussed the ""historic memory"" of the holocaust.   In an interview with an Italian media outlet released on Sunday, Lavrov claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""puts forward an argument of what kind of Nazism can they have if he himself is Jewish"".  Lavrov, according to a transcript posted on the Russian foreign ministry website, then added: ""I could be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood"".  Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid labelled the comments ""an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error.""  Bennett denounced the comments as ""lies""that he said effectively ""accuse the Jews themselves of the most awful crimes in history"", perpetrated against themselves.   Russia's ambassador to Israel was summoned to ""clarify"" the remarks.   Israel has sought to tread a delicate line since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with Bennett stressing Israel's close ties to both Moscow and Kyiv.  Bennett has in particular sought to preserve Russian cooperation with Israeli strikes in Syria, where Russian forces are on the ground.   Israel has so far refused Ukraine's requests for military support, instead suppling bullet proof vests and helmets for medical workers, as well as an Israeli field hospital.  Bennett has attempted to mediate in the conflict and is among a handful of world leaders to meet with Putin since the invasion, travelling to Moscow in early March.",Politics
58,"If Roe v. Wade falls, are LGBTQ rights next?","Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion overruling Roe v. Wade, which was leaked to Politico and revealed to the public Monday night, is more than just an attack on abortion. It is a manifesto laying out a comprehensive theory of which rights are protected by the Constitution and which rights should not be enforced by the courts.  And Alito’s opinion is also a warning that, after Roe falls, the Court’s Republican majority may come for landmark LGBTQ rights decisions next, such as the marriage equality decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) or the sexual autonomy decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003).  To be clear, the leaked opinion is a draft. While Politico reports that five justices initially voted to overrule Roe, no justice’s vote is final until the Court officially hands down its decision. And even if Alito holds onto the five votes he needs to overrule Roe, one or more of his colleagues in the majority could insist that he make changes to the opinion.  Alito’s first draft, however, suggests that the archconservative justice feels emboldened. Not only does he take a maximalist approach to tearing down Roe, but much of Alito’s reasoning in the draft opinion tracks arguments he’s made in the past in dissenting opinions disparaging LGBTQ rights.  The Constitution is a frustrating document. Among other things, it contains multiple provisions stating that Americans enjoy certain civil rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the document itself. The Ninth Amendment, for example, provides that “the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”  Over time, the Supreme Court has devised multiple different standards to determine which of those unenumerated rights are nonetheless protected by our founding document. Some of these standards are very much at odds with each other.  The central thrust of Alito’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case seeking to overrule Roe, is that only rights that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” are protected. This method of weighing unenumerated rights is often referred to as the “Glucksberg” test, after the Court’s decision in Washington v. Glucksberg (1997). ",Politics

60,No magic wands for Cong. revival: Sonia,"Special Correspondent New Delhi  There are no magic wands to ensure the party’s accelerated revival except selfless work, discipline and an over-riding sense of unity and cohesion, Congress president Sonia Gandhi told the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Monday.  The CWC met to formalise the agenda of the three-day long Nav Sankalp Chintan Shivir in Udaipur from May 13. Making her opening remarks, Ms. Gandhi noted that the brainstorming meet should not be reduced to a ritual and urged her colleagues to repay their debt to the party in full measure.  Key areas  The heads of the six panels that were formed to draft discussion papers pertaining to political issues, economy, social justice, farmers, youth and organisational issues made their presentations.  A separate wing to manage elections, revival of the Parliamentary Board, regular training of workers and a cooling-off period for District and Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs were among the key discussion points. The need for ideological clarity was also discussed at the CWC meet, a source said.  Growing communal polarisation, hate campaigns against minorities, compromising the dignity of parliamentary institutions, misuse of Central agencies to target opponents, and Centre-State relations were among the key political issues that were raised.  Only bullet points on each of the six broad areas were shared by the heads of these subject committees, the source added.  A senior CWC member is said to have pointed out that a separate meet to strategise on how to effectively carry out a Jan Jagaran Abhiyan (people’s movement) should also be held on the lines of the Chintan Shivir.  ‘Repay debt to party’  The tone for the meet was set by Ms. Gandhi who stressed the point of discipline and noted that “self-criticism within party forums is needed but it should not be done in a manner that self-confidence and morale is eroded and an atmosphere of gloom and doom becomes all-pervasive”.  “There are no magic wands. It is only with selfless work, discipline and a sense of consistent collective purpose that we will demonstrate our tenacity and resilience,” Ms. Gandhi said.  “The party has been central to the life of each and every one of us. It has expected our total allegiance and has been good to each and every one of us. Now, when we are at a crucial juncture, it is imperative that we step forward and repay our debt to the party in full measure,” she added.  At a press conference later, senior leaders Jairam Ramesh and Randeep Surjewala announced that 422 party members, out of which 50% were under the age of 50 and 21% women, would take part in the Chintan Shivir.",Politics
61,Russia is defending motherland: Putin,"Agence France-Presse Moscow  President Vladimir Putin defended Russia’s war in Ukraine as necessary to protect the “motherland” as Moscow flexed its military muscle on Monday at a huge parade marking the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.  Fierce battles raged in eastern Ukraine while Mr. Putin made his Victory Day speech against a backdrop of intercontinental ballistic missiles rumbling through Red Square.  Mr. Putin made no major announcements on Russia’s next steps but channelled Russian pride in its Second World War triumph to mobilise support for the Ukraine invasion.  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, whose forces are locked in battle with Russian troops in the east, used the occasion to say he would not allow Moscow to appropriate the Soviet Union’s triumph in Second World War.  The conflict is mired in the history between ex-Soviet neighbours Ukraine and Russia, with Mr. Putin saying the “special military operation” in Ukraine is in part to “de-Nazify” the country.  Mr. Putin blamed the West and Ukraine for today’s conflict, telling thousands of troops in Red Square that Russia faced an “absolutely unacceptable threat” and warning against the “horror of a global war”.  “You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no-one forgets the lessons of the Second World War,” he told Russian forces, shortly after intercontinental ballistic missiles rumbled through the square.  The celebration also featured 11,000 troops and more than 130 military vehicles, although a planned military flypast was cancelled.  On the ground, the key battles are being fought in Ukraine's east, which Russia is seeking to secure having tried and failed to take the capital Kyiv and the north.  The Governor of eastern Luhansk region, Sergiy Gaiday, said on Monday there were “very serious battles” around Bilogorivka and Rubizhne, as Russia tries to take the Russian-speaking Donbas. Donbas encompasses Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk.  An AFP team saw columns of trucks filled with soldiers and heavy equipment move down the main road leading away from the city of Severodonetsk, suggesting Ukraine was giving up the defence of its last stronghold in Luhansk.  Heavy shelling  Russian forces were heavily shelling the roads, while the Ukrainians were firing back to help cover the apparent pullout.  Mr. Zelensky, who spoke an hour before Mr. Putin, had invoked the ghosts of Second World War to chide Russia. “We will not allow anyone to annex this victory. We will not allow it to be appropriated,” he said.  In Kyiv, the commemoration day was largely shunned as life slowly returned to normal, weeks after fierce fighting raged in its suburbs",Politics
62,A dissonance in India-German ties,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Germany on May 2 came at a critical time, shaped by the ongoing Ukraine war. In recent times, New Delhi has been at its assertive best. Even as the United States and the European nations have applied sanctions on Moscow and provided military aid to Ukraine, New Delhi has refused to play ball. It has not only avoided condemning Moscow by abstaining in the United Nations (UN) on critical votes on the war but has also continued to engage with Moscow to increase its import of cheap crude. Its long-standing and traditional defence links with Russia remain intact. Such moves have raised eyebrows and attracted some amount of criticism from the West. New Delhi, however, insists that its position on the war is non-partisan and should be appreciated by its allies and friends.  For a nuanced stance  However, assertive media and conference statements by India’s External Affairs Minister notwithstanding, there is growing recognition in India’s strategic circles that New Delhi has to bring in more nuance to its approach with Europe. Given India’s stature, being completely isolated by the West is certainly not a best-case scenario. However, with an assertive China on the world stage and in particular, at the border with India, New Delhi needs to manage a delicate balancing act while asserting its right to pursue its national interests and strategic autonomy in foreign policy. Mr. Modi’s three-nation Europe tour (May 2-4) needs to be contextualised with these factors in the backdrop.  There is a clear, albeit delayed, move toward a unified response vis-à-vis Russia in Europe. Its significant reliance on Russian gas and crude notwithstanding, condemnation of Moscow’s moves in Ukraine is near unanimous in Europe. Not surprisingly, India’s abstention in the UN votes and its continuation of its relationship with Russia have raised quite a few hackles in Germany. In private as well as public discussions, India’s role as a major power and largest democracy are being brought to the forefront and there is a growing expectation that India needs to make a shift from its position on Russia and join hands with the European countries and the U.S. in protecting democracy in need. Amidst these expectations and pressure tactics, whether the Prime Minister’s visit to Germany helped change the perception and bridge the gap that has been growing, assumes critical importance.  Mr. Modi’s visit took place during the first term of the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Prior to Mr. Modi’s visit, the Chancellor had visited Japan, in his first visit to Asia. This is construed as a sign of Germany reaching out to other Asian powers and building on democratic alliances as an outcome of its Indo-Pacific guidelines. These two meetings had raised, albeit mistakenly, expectations among some analysts here in Germany of a democratic dividend that may lead to a convergence of views and possibly policies on Russia between the two countries. As proved by the Ukraine war, however, New Delhi has chosen to prioritise its interests over pursuing a policy that is shaped by common democratic values that define Germany, Japan and India.  The China factor  In fact, for several years now, Indian policies have resisted promoting democracy in the neighbourhood and have instead opted to deal with de facto powers. Afghanistan, where India is still reluctant to do business with the Taliban, is probably an aberration. On the other hand, India’s policy towards Myanmar’s junta is defined by this pragmatism. Therefore, the democratic rationale of a convergence of interests to protect democratic values is hardly a strong binding chord between India and Germany. The geopolitical convergence of countering the rise of China particularly in the Indo-Pacific seems to be a more compelling necessity rather than the ideational and normative aspects of protecting democratic norms and values.  Engagement with Europe  New Delhi’s objective is multifaceted as far its relations with Europe in general and Germany in particular is concerned. So far, it has not revised its position on Russia and Ukraine, by continuing to underline its unequivocal condemnation of the violence. However, unlike the West, India makes it clear that irrespective of its position on a solitary issue of geopolitical relevance, which the former may find difficult to reconcile with, the bilateral engagement with countries such as Germany, France and Denmark remains at the top of its priority. The purpose of such a policy is clearly to present itself as not being isolated but as a swing power that can move deftly on the geopolitical and diplomatic chessboard.  Towards this direction, the holding of the sixth India-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations (IGC), a biennial format which India conducts with Germany, assumed critical importance. India attaches significant importance to the ‘long-standing commercial ties’ with Germany, an important pillar of the ‘Strategic Partnership’, which the two nations entered into in 2000. The idea, therefore, is to highlight a convergence of issues of economics, technology and climate change (low hanging fruits), in spite of the intensifying dissonance on democratic and strategic issues. That remains the crux of the Indian approach.  Room for full ties  It remains a fact that India-Germany relations have yet to achieve their full potential. One of the factors for that, possibly, is the lack of understanding of each other’s strategic cultures and domestic politics. It is doubtful that Mr. Modi’s visit changed any of that, particularly in the absence of any media interaction and strategic communication. Germany has invited Mr. Modi to the G-7 meeting in June this year, construed as a bid to wean India away from its position on Russia. However, while the attempt may not be successful, it is certainly a pointer to the emerging multipolarity in the international system, which provides space for major powers such as Germany and India to play a greater role in bringing peace and stability in other theatres, particularly in Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific. In times of shifting geopolitical alliances and realignments, India and Germany can emerge as important poles in shaping the new world order.

64,Pakistan PM warns of action against Imran,"Press Trust of India New Delhi  Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has accused his predecessor Imran Khan of planning to trigger a civil war in the country and warned of legal action for concocting a narrative against the country’s national institutions.  His remarks came on the heels of Pakistan Army warning its critics to avoid throwing dirt on the premier institution as it took “strong exception” to “intensified and deliberate attempts” to drag it into politics after the removal of Mr. Khan-led government last month.  Mr. Khan had told his audience that Siraj ud-Daula was the Governor of Bengal appointed by the Mughal Emperor and his commander-in-chief, Mir Jaffar, joined hands with the English to topple Daula’s government. In the same vein, the former premier alleged his government was toppled by “the Mir Jafars and Mir Sadiqs of today”.",Politics
65,‘China’s intent is to keep boundary issue alive’,"Dinakar Peri NEW DELHI  The basic issue with China remains resolution of the border and what is seen is China’s intent to keep “the boundary issue alive”, according to Army chief Gen. Manoj Pande. In eastern Ladakh, India’s aim and intention, as far as the situation is concerned, is to restore the status quo ante prior to April 2020, he said in an interaction with a group of journalists on Monday.  On the impact of the Ukraine war, he observed that the foremost one was the relevance of conventional wars still remained and they need not necessarily be short and swift. He acknowledged that the Army’s supply chains were impacted to “some extent” but asserted that there was sufficient stock to last for a “reasonable” period of time.  “The first and foremost challenge is the resolution of the situations along the borders prevailing since April/May 2020. Our aim and intention as far as the situation is concerned is to restore the status quo ante prior to April 2020 in eastern Ladakh. Our intention is also re-establish the trust and tranquillity on both sides,” Gen. Pande said. “It cannot be a one-way affair. Efforts should be made from the sides.”  On relations with China, he said the basic issue remained the resolution of the border matter. “What we see is that China’s intent has been to keep the boundary issue alive. What we need as a country is a ‘whole of nation’ approach and in the military domain, this is to prevent and counter any attempt to alter the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).”  Important lessons  To a question from The Hindu on the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war on the Indian Army’s preparedness, he stated that it had important lessons. The foremost was that the relevance of a conventional war still remained. “We are seeing many platforms — artillery guns, air defence guns, rockets, missiles and tanks being employed in this war in one way or the other. It also tells us that wars need not be necessarily be short and swift. It could prolong in a manner the current conflict is.”  The second important lesson would be to try and be self-reliant in terms of weapons, armaments, equipment and spares from outside. “We are dependent on certain weapon systems specially in the area of air defence, rockets, missiles and certain tanks from Russia and Ukraine,” he noted. Increasing the self-reliance and decreasing the dependence on outside sources was an important lesson. “We have already started this, in keeping with the Make in India initiative as also to attain ‘Aatmanirbharta’,” he explained.  As far as the immediate impact was concerned, he said, “the supply chain of certain spares and ammunition has got impacted to some extent, but we have adequate stocks to last for a reasonable period of time.” They were also looking at certain alternative mitigation measures and identifying alternative sources from friendly foreign countries, while in the long term, this was also an opportunity for the private industry to step up production and meet the requirements.  The third important issue was the aspect of non-contact or non-kinetic warfare and the lesson had come out “loud and clear”. Elaborating, he asserted that “be it the cyber domain or information domain, we have seen the battle of narratives has been used to gain advantage over the adversary. We need to increasingly focus on the new domains of warfare, focus on capability development.”  In the broader scenario, Gen. Pande said, the emerging geopolitical order was something that should be monitored very closely in terms of realignment and in terms of new alliances. That was something which would perhaps be much clear once the conflict ended.  On the situation in eastern Ladakh, he pointed out that through dialogue at the Corps Commander level between the two countries “many friction areas have been resolved after talking to each other” and the balance areas could “only be resolved through dialogue”.  “It is good that we are talking to and engaging with each other. Our troops continue to hold important positions along the LAC,” he stressed. The guidance to the troops was to “have a firm and resolute” posture to “prevent any efforts to alter the status quo.”  The Army had reoriented its troops from the west to the northern borders since the stand-off. There was a “re-appraisal and re-assessment” of the preparedness. “We have a ‘robust posture’ on the LAC and ‘adequate forces to deal with all contingencies’.”  In this direction, he said, the Army had to remain prepared to face a variety of challenges on the entire spectrum.",Politics
66,Akhilesh demands HC-monitored probe into Chandauli woman’s death,"Omar RashidLUCKNOW  Stating that he does not trust the Uttar Pradesh police investigation, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday demanded that a sitting High Court judge-monitored probe be conducted into the death of a woman in Chandauli during a police raid at her house.  He also demanded that the police team be booked for murder.  On May 1, a police team had reached Manrajpur village under the Sayedraja police station jurisdiction in search of Kanhaiya Yadav, an accused under the Gangsters Act, with a non-bailable warrant. The police team was accused of beating to death his daughter Nisha.  Subsequently, an FIR was registered against the Station House Officer and other police personnel for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt and house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint.  While the police had initially said prima facie it was a case of suicide, the cause of death remained unclear after the autopsy. The viscera was sent for forensic examination.  Mr. Yadav reached Chandauli and met the aggrieved family. “The police can cook up any story and can twist it the way they like,” he said.  He demanded that not only the girl’s family be provided security, but the probe be conducted under the supervision of a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court. “We don’t trust the government probe. This government can do anything and can change any report,” he told journalists. Mr. Yadav also accused the U.P. police of indulging in “dabangai (high-handedness)”.  ‘Concocting stories’  “First they lodged cases against their father and expelled him from the district under political pressure,” Mr. Yadav said, referring to the police raid at Kanhaiya Yadav’s home.  He also demanded that the police team be booked for murder. While the family of the woman, who was in her early twenties, had accused the police team of murder, a case was registered against the personnel for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The local SHO was suspended.  Mr. Yadav did not believe the police theory that the woman took her own life in the house during the raid. “U.P. police are ahead in concocting stories,” said the former U.P. Chief Minister.

67,Puja at Kashmir temple stokes controversy,"Special Correspondent SRINAGAR  A religious event chaired by Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday at the 8th Century protected site of Martand Temple in south Kashmir’s Anantnag has landed in a controversy as the  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) denied that it had issued any permission for holding puja at the core protected area on the premises.  Mr. Sinha on Sunday took part in the Navgrah Ashtamangalam puja at the ancient Martand Sun Temple in Mattan, Anantnag. The event saw the presence of saints, members of Kashmiri Pandit community and local residents, according to Raj Bhawan. Later, the L-G termed the event a truly divine experience.  “We are making dedicated efforts to transform historical spiritual places of J&K into vibrant centres that will guide us on the path of righteousness and bless this beautiful land with peace, happiness and prosperity,” the L-G said after the puja.  The ASI officials told The Hindu that the department was alerted about the visit of the L-G but “no permission was sought for puja” at the protected site.  The ASI does not allow religious events at protected monuments except the customary prayers that were being held prior to the ASI takeover. It was for the first time that a puja of this scale was held within 200 metres of the core protected site, said another ASI official.  “This will set a precedent for other protected monuments in Kashmir,” a senior ex-ASI official said.",Politics
