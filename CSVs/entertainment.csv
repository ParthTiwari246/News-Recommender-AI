29,From Uruguay to Auroville: clowning duo brings physicality and humour to the stage,"If the slow afternoons in Adishakti Theatre Arts are characterised by calming conversations and verdant greens, evenings are simply a world away. In one corner lined by earthen lamps, a song is in the air as artistes hug each other a little too tight, after two bleak years. In another, people sway gently to the guitar tunes. The scene is bittersweet; a breath of fresh air. Remembering Veenapani, the non-ticketed annual theatre festival that commemorates Veenapani Chawla, the founder of Adishakti, is thus back again after two years. And the feeling of warmth is familiar.     The theatre is packed. Andrés Fagiolino and Betina Domínguez from Uruguay, armed with antics and heavily powdered faces, are on a wild search amid many coffee cups hung from above. They are searching for ‘maashi’. What is ‘maashi’? Some in the audience say it’s magic. It could be hope or even a commodity like, say, water. They clown their way through a narrative that is both simple and abstract, with effortless physicality (handstands and human flags galore). Amares Teatro, as the duo is called, has travelled extensively across the world with their clowning techniques. Their play Rio captures the relationship between two individuals in the face of scarcity, which received thunderous applause and a rather lengthy standing ovation at Adishakti last week.   Enveloped by the afternoon lull, Andrés and Betina sit down for a conversation before the much-anticipated performance. Their glances to each other speak of an obvious chemistry that translates well on stage. The duo has been travelling performers since 2015. While Andres, who has a background in Biochemistry, strayed into hospital clowning purely by chance in 2007, Betina has been a circus artiste since she was 13 years old.   “In 2015, I met Andrés and we started travelling along with four others, who taught me more about clowning and physical theatre,” says Betina. After touring in Latin America, Amares Teatro had been in Kenya and Egypt before arriving in India, to perform Rio non-verbally. “It was originally written by us in 2016 and premiered in Ecuador, in Spanish. The beauty of the show is that it adapts to its audiences, irrespective of geographical boundaries, which is essentially what clowning is,” says Andrés. “Clowning is about live conversations. While we are talking to you, we adapt to you and you may adapt to us. It is set in the present,” says Andres. He adds, “The basic dramaturgy is still, but there are always gaps that adapt to the environment and the day we perform in.” For instance, they use words, noises and inflections throughout the play to connect with the audience: and those words, most often gibberish, will be repeatedly used in reference to a concept or idea, much like ‘maashi’ in Rio.  And so, the duo’s repertoire is spread across monasteries, hospitals, kindergartens and prisons, miles away from the conventional stage. Betina recalls the experience of performing in a women’s penitentiary in Peru to an audience of about 500 prisoners. “They were reacting a lot to the little things I did. They had a lot of contained energy. It was a very powerful show,” says Betina. And such experiences are what makes clowning more rewarding than any other form of theater Finally, being a clown is also a journey within, says Andrés. “Clowning teaches you to see things as is, without hiding it away,” Betina quips in. The lightness or humor in clowning does not necessarily lend to shallowness, as many think. As puts it, “We say that clowns come from innocence; but they arrive from innocence after experience. Innocence may be child-like, but not childish.”",Entertainment
30,‘Prithviraj’ trailer launch: Akshay Kumar calls historical ‘an educational film to be shown in schools’,"Akshay Kumar on Monday said his upcoming historical film ""Prithviraj"" should be mandatory viewing for children in schools as it talks about king Prithviraj Chauhan, who has been reduced to ""only a paragraph"" in history.  Directed by noted writer-director Chandraparaksh Dwivedi, the film features Kumar in the titular role of the ruler. During the trailer launch event of the historical drama, the 54-year-old actor said he learnt about the life and times of Prithviraj through the book ""Prithviraj Raso"" and realised how little people know about the ruler.  ""I was given a book to read, 'Prithviraj Raso' by Dr saab (Dwivedi). I read the book slowly and realised how big a warrior he was. But when we read about him in history, he was reduced to just a paragraph,"" Kumar told reporters.  The actor said ""Prithviraj"" can be best described as an ""educational film"" and hoped the younger generation watches it for better understanding of history. ""Today, I want every child, not just in India but in the world to watch the film. It is an educational film. You would want to show your kids what Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan's story was. I am extremely proud to work in the film. I wish my mother... If she was here, she would have been so proud,"" Kumar, who lost his mother last year, said.  The actor also requested the government to arrange the film's screening in schools so that it reaches a wider audience.  Kumar said ""Prithviraj"" has been painstakingly researched and chronicles only the ""truth"".  ""I would also request the government that they make it compulsory viewing in school, so that the kids learn about our history, what and how everything happened.  ""Everything you see in the film is true, it has indeed happened. But we don't know about it and I find this really amusing. Dr saab has been researching this for 18 years! That's the amount of hardwork he has put in the film,"" he added.  Dwivedi is best known for directing and starring in television epic “Chanakya” (1991) and the Partition feature film “Pinjar” (2003).",Entertainment
31,Breaking the barrier by teaching Bharatanatyam to Irula girls,"It looks like an unlikely setting for a Bharatanatyam class. The stamping of feet on the floor in tune with the jathis of Bharatanatyam fills the small hall with a tin roof of the Thai Tamil Palli at Tindivanam. Bharatanatyam dancer and Fulbright Scholar in Residence Kausalya Srinivasan beats the thattu palakai and a group of seven girls belonging to the Irular community are learning their first lessons in dancing.  “It is the traditional dance of Tamil Nadu and take pride in learning it,” Ms. Srinivasan tells the students as she constantly corrects their posture.  “The way you stand, the way to speak, and the way you make gestures matter a lot. It will improve your body language, confidence and personality,” reiterates Ms. Srinivasan, who seeks to break the barrier by teaching classical dance to the girls on the margins of society.  The girls are attentive though it takes some time for them to adjust themselves to the discomforts of the new attire of the dancers brought to them by Ms. Srinivasan.  “I never thought I would learn Bharatanatyam in my life. Who would have taught us? I wanted to dance when other students in my college participated in cultural programmes. One day, I will also dance on the dais,” said I. Sakthi, who studies B.Sc physics at the A. Govindsamy Government Arts College, Tindivanam.  “I wonder how she [Ms. Srinivasan] always has a cheerful demeanour and sounds confident. I feel I can also be [always cheerful] like her if I dance,” she said.  For K. Bhuvana and M. Gunasundarai, the Class 9 students, the dream has come true. “I liked to dance at school functions. But never had the opportunity or confidence. I will learn it well,” Bhuvana said on Sunday.  Ms. Srinivasan decided to teach Bharatanatyam to underprivileged children after participating in the Millennium Stage created with the objective of making performing arts accessible to everyone in fulfillment of the U.S.-based Kennedy Centre’s mission to its community and the nation.  When she approached retired Madras High Court judge K. Chandru, he advised her to meet Professor Kalyani, founder of Thai Tamil Palli, who works among the Irulas and fights for their rights. After a couple of meetings with Mr. Kalyani, she decided to go ahead.  “I liked the idea because I feel a person’s personality will not be complete without learning an art. Art will give confidence to students,” said Mr. Kalyani, who also wanted Ms. Srinvasan to include some students from his school [in her classes].  Asked whether these students could get a space on stage, especially when classical dances remain an exclusive domain of a privileged section, Ms. Srinivasan said she would create a space for them. “We have to begin somewhere. I will organise their arangetram one day. Since they are students, I will recommend their name for the Fulbright scholarship so that they could study in the U.S.,” she added.",Entertainment
32,India urged to conduct lawful probe after Xiaomi allegations,"Ananth Krishnan Hong Kong  China’s government on Monday asked India to carry out investigations “in accordance with laws”, following claims of coercion from smartphone maker Xiaomi during ongoing investigations into its financial practices.  India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday said claims of Xiaomi India’s officials that their statements were taken “under coercion” were “untrue and baseless”. It noted it had recorded statements from Manu Kumar Jain, former head of Xiaomi India and current Global VP, as well as Chief Financial Officer Sameer Rao.  The ED said the last statement from them was recorded on April 26 while the order to seize the company’s assets was passed three days later. “No complaint was filed by them at any point of time during recording of statements at various occasions,” the agency said, adding that “it appears that allegation now made after passage of substantial time is an afterthought.”  The Karnataka High Court on Saturday stayed the April 29 order, under which ₹5,551.27 crore was seized under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, the Press Trust of India reported.  ‘Closely monitoring’  In its first comments on the developments, China’s Foreign Ministry on Monday said it was “closely monitoring the matter.”  “The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies overseas to operate in accordance with laws and regulations,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. “In the meantime, we firmly support Chinese companies in protecting their lawful rights and interests. We hope the Indian side can provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies making investment and operating in the country, and conduct investigation and law enforcement in accordance with laws and regulations so as to beef up the international community’s confidence in investment.”  Xiaomi India, in a court filing, claimed that its officials were threatened with consequences if they did not submit compliant statements, allegations that the ED has rejected.  The company’s operations in India have been under investigation over remittance payments which authorities said were illegal. Xiaomi, however, has maintained the payments were royalties. A hearing in the case is set for later this week.",Entertainment
33,"Photographer Mike Sullivan, who was recently in India, uses his masks to explore the performative nature of identity","The process of mask making started out very impulsively for Mike. And very soon it became an extension of himself, and a way to communicate with the world Shards of mirrors, feathers, jewels, delicate leaves and flowers. These are the objects American artist and photographer Mike Sullivan, 28, uses to tell his stories, with the help of the masks and headpieces he fashions.  To Mike, these are not just objects of beauty, but a safe space for the wearer. “People are incredibly vulnerable when we are creating an image together. Masks and crowns help them feel an inner sense of liberation and self worth,” he says. Mike visited India at the start of the year, and the three weeks he spent between Kerala, Goa and Karnataka became an impromptu creative residency. He explored local flower markets, jewellery shops and collaborated with artists along the way, including Goa-based photographer Pretika Menon. “I created far more than I expected and am extremely grateful for how open people were,” he says.  It was his training in theatre in Ithaca College, New York, followed by a semester at Ithaca College London Center, that led him to grow deeply interested in mask making. “For a Shakespeare/Grecian section of the semester, we had to create and perform in our own masks, which was the first leg in my journey as a mask maker.”",Entertainment

35,One of Multiverse of Madness’s 2 credits scenes is a huge casting announcement,"By the end of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, our hero (Benedict Cumberbatch) has managed to save the multiverse from the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) a.k.a. Wanda Maximoff, who was under the influence of the evil magic book known as the Darkhold.  That victory didn’t come without its losses, as Wanda killed an astonishing number of people across multiple universes, all to find a world where she could be with her twin boys. Doctor Strange not only watched his fellow Avenger plunge into inescapable darkness, but also witnessed said murders, and realized that no matter the universe, he could never be with the love of his life, Christine (Rachel McAdams).  But his job isn’t done. The mid-credits scene is set sometime after the events of the movie. Doctor Strange is accosted on what appears to be a street in New York City (where the sorcerer lives). Who could it be?  The one and only Charlize Theron, in superhero garb.  She knows who he is, which isn’t surprising, given that he’s famous for traveling across the multiverse. He doesn’t seem to know her, but he hears her out. Theron tells him there’s a universe that’s experiencing an incursion, the Marvel term for when an unstable universe collapses in on itself (mainly because of multiverse shenanigans). She asks him for help, and he says he’s ready to go. The two jump through a portal to save the aforementioned universe and the scene ends. ",Entertainment
36,Santoor maestro Shivkumar Sharma passes away,"Pt. Shivkumar Sharma, veteran santoor maestro, passed away in Mumbai due to cardiac arrest. He was 84. Hailing from Jammu, Pt. Shivkumar, put the multiple-string santoor at the centre stage. He adapted the instrument to play Hindustani music and became its foremost exponent. He was also suffering from renal ailments.  Along with celebrated flautist Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia, he also composed music for many Hindi films. His son and disciple Rahul, a santoor artiste, has been taking his father's legacy forward.  Sharma, one of India’s most well-known classical musicians, was due to perform in Bhopal next week. “He had a severe heart attack at around 9 a.m. He was active and was to perform in Bhopal next week. He was on regular dialysis but was still was active,” the family source told PTI. A Padma Vibhushan recipient, Sharma was born in Jammu in 1938 and is believed to be the first musician to have played Indian classical music on the santoor, a folk instrument from Jammu and Kashmir. As one half of musician duo Shiv-Hari, he composed music with flute legend Pt. Hari Prasad Chaurasia for an array of films such as “Silsila”, “Lamhe” and “Chandni”.  “The passing away of Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharmaji marks the end of an era. He was the pioneer of santoor and his contribution is unparalleled. For me, it’s a personal loss and I will miss him no end. May his soul rest in peace. His music lives on forever!

37,Ruskin Bond: transcending time,"R. Krithika  A young boy discovers a hidden pool inside a forest and rushes to inform his two best friends. The three embark on an exploration of the area. They swim, try fishing, ride the buffaloes that wallow in the pool, even try to enlarge the pool by building a dam.  It is 1857, India is in a ferment. When Ruth’s father is killed by the Indian soldiers, the family finds shelter in a friend’s house. But Javed Khan, the Pathan leader of the rebels, finds them and kidnaps them. He falls in love with Ruth but her mother will not allow her daughter to marry a rebel.  If the first, The Hidden Pool, left you musing about friendships and relationships that fall by the wayside; A Flight of Pigeons took one back into a tumultuous time. Two very different books by the same author. For many, Ruskin Bond is a children’s author. No doubt, he is. But Bond, who turns 88 on May 19, is also much more given that his writing includes novels, essays, short stories, and memoirs.  Coming of age  In his Lone Fox Dancing, Bond offers a moving account of his early years and, for good measure, references many of his stories. However, what was disappointing was to learn that all those fascinating tales of his eccentric grandfather were “either made up or based on hearsay”. His life with his father and later his mother and stepfather, trip to England and return to India, which he considers home, are all dealt with here.  His first book, The Room on The Roof about a young boy’s coming of age, was based on his own experiences of living in a rented room in Dehradun. It won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1957. Bond was then in London trying to make a living. The publication of this novel allowed him to return to India. “All I really wanted was my little room back again,” he writes in his autobiography.  Following his return, he settled in Mussoorie and began to write stories for magazines and newspapers. Rusty, his protagonist in The Room on the Roof, makes a comeback in Vagrants in the Valley. As you laugh over Rusty’s and Kishen’s adventures, you cannot help but muse over what loneliness and friendship mean to different people.  On the silver screen  A short story collection about Rusty followed and the stories found their place in school textbooks and were even adapted for a television show. Other short stories like The Blue Umbrella and Susanna’s Seven Husbands were adapted as feature films, as was his novel A Flight of Pigeons. Bond even made a cameo appearance in Saat Khoon Maaf, which was based on Susanna’s Seven Husbands.  Most of his stories hark back to another time — of simple lives and small places where everyone knew everyone. But what keeps the reader coming back to them is the emotion that infuses the words. Bond’s people are real; ones you probably know and are familiar with. And their lives are unpredictable, just like ours. In Friends in Small Places, Bond writes that dull people “are those whose lives are too orderly or those who are forever boasting of the ease with which they have succeeded in life.”  Painting nature  Then there are his descriptions of nature. His use of words is sparse but the pictures they paint are vivid. Take these lines from his short story The Leopard: “The stream ran close by the verge, tumbling over smooth pebbles, over rocks worn yellow with age, on its way to the plains and to the little Song River and finally to the sacred Ganga.” The complete life-cycle of a stream is conjured up without fuss. Without being moralistic or preachy, the story also calls for co-existence with wild animals.  And his ghost stories! A personal favourite is A Face in the Dark, which has found its way into school textbooks. The tale is about a teacher’s encounters with a strange boy and a school watchman but what leaves you thirsting is that you don’t know what happens at the end. There’s no neat denouement; just more suspense.  As I think of the pleasure his writing has given me, I can’t help but recall what he said about his writing: “I’m like a shopkeeper hoarding bags full of grains; only, I hoard words. There are still people who buy words and I hope I can keep bringing a little sunshine and pleasure into their lives to the end of my days.” I hope you’ll be doing that for a long time yet, Mr. Bond.",Entertainment
38,Ji Chang-wook smiles again in ‘The Sound of Magic’,"The actor, who steps into the musical fantasy genre with his new Netflix drama, The Sound of Magic, talks about broadening his range and choosing with his heart He was the mysterious night courier in Healer, the suave secret agent in The K2, and the tyrannical emperor in Empress Ki. Ji Chang-wook’s versatility and good looks are often discussed in the same breath. Now, he is back on screen as the enigmatic and free-spirited magician Ri-eul, in The Sound of Magic.  Directed by Kim Sung-youn, who previously helmed the hit series Iteawon Class (2020) and Love in the Moonlight (2016), it is a screen adaptation of the popular webtoon, Annarasumanara.  Over a morning video call, Chang-wook explains how he is no stranger to the stage. He was a returning member on the musical, The Days, through 2013 to 2016. The challenge, however, for both him and director Sung-youn, lay in adapting comic artist Ha Il-kwon’s black-and-white illustrations to a colourful musical fantasy.  For the 34-year-old, the project was an opportunity to showcase his repertoire as a performer. “The music, choreography and vocal training reminded me of my theatre days. Playing this magician who is child-like, frank and emotional on the one hand, but also mysterious, appealed to me,” he says. Chang-wook, one of the most searched names across social media, is completing 15 years in show business. The actor who shot to fame as speed skater Dong Hae in Smile Again (2010) has carved a niche for himself as the action hero, with dramas such as Healer (2014), The K2 (2016) and Fabricated City (2017). However, he now wants to widen his range. After completing his military service in 2019, several of his projects, including Melting Me Softly, Backstreet Rookies and Love Struck in the City were met with lukewarm response. He says his choices are instinctive. “For me, it’s quite personal. [I choose] depending on what interests me at that moment. It’s also important that the script is engaging.”  While he admits that he has not “set any standards for myself as such”, he adds that he wants to do roles that resonate with him. He signed The Sound of Magic almost immediately because the story — of lost childhood dreams and growing pains — struck an emotional chord. “It brought back memories of my own growing up years, of the death of my father and the difficulties we went through as a family,” he says, adding “It drew me to this story of hope and miracles.” ",Entertainment

40,"Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, and their $50 million defamation suit, explained","America is watching the defamation trial of Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard in Fairfax, Virginia, and America appears to be deeply confused by it. Vanity Fair reports that as Court TV broadcasts the trial, it has doubled its daytime ratings. Hashtags associated with the trial have repeatedly trended across Twitter, as viewers watch and discuss the celebrity case of the year — its messiness, its scandal, the glamorous movie stars at its heart, and the question of what to believe and how much.  This is a murky, perplexing trial. While it’s technically a defamation trial over a newspaper article — with Depp suing Heard — at its center is one big conflict. Amber Heard says Johnny Depp abused her. Depp says Heard abused him. So what’s the truth?  Strikingly for our post-Me Too world, it looks as though the loudest voices on the internet have overwhelmingly sided with Depp. While there’s compelling evidence that there was violence on both sides of this marriage, it’s not quite so clear that the evidence supports Depp’s story, or that he has much of a shot at winning this case.  What Depp does have is the stronger public profile. Though it’s been over a decade since he put out a true critical hit, he’s delivered enough acclaimed work over the course of his long career to earn himself a fair amount of goodwill.  The star of hits like Edward Scissorhands, Donnie Brasco, and the many, many Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Depp has been nominated for three Oscars and been named People’s Sexiest Man Alive twice. For a while, at least, he was one of those people who are so bankable that they seem able to get away with anything: a white man who is also a true A-list sex symbol. He was up there in the upper echelon: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Johnny Depp.  As Depp’s film career declined over the course of the 2010s, his personal and financial troubles began. In 2017, Depp sued both his longtime business managers and his entertainment lawyer, claiming they had mismanaged his finances.",Entertainment

45,"Richa Chadha on playing a sex worker, the world of audio shows, and more","Actor Richa Chadha, after delivering multiple striking performances on-screen, is now busy exploring the world of audio. Chadha, alongside Jaideep Ahlawat, plays a sex worker in Audible’s latest show, Baby Doll, a revenge drama based in the hinterland.  Baby (Chadha) is a hurt and humiliated sex worker, who takes on a dreaded underworld don, played by Jaideep Ahlawat, to avenge the violent death of her friend.  Richa talks to us about the show, the politics of the sex trade in the country and her upcoming projects. I have done audio shows before, but it is my first time doing a pure Hindi hinterland (audio) show and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. You get to engage the audience with purely your voice; you have nothing else to offer. It is just a whole world created by the sound programmer and foley artist.   In terms of preparation, we did multiple readings. My accent had to be diluted to reflect my character’s background; the readings helped me figure out the right voice.   [A foley artist creates sound effects in a studio during post-production. These sounds include anything from the sound of a glass breaking to the sound of footsteps and a punch landing on a person’s face]  Did you work with any dialect coaches for the show?  No (laughs) I know the belt the story is set in very well, and I am quite good at picking up different Indian accents, so I did not work with any dialect coaches.  How does the visual aesthetic of a character translate to audio shows? Is it solely based on voice modulation and dialect?  For us, it is just voice acting and then the production work begins, where you add sound effects of what is happening from the world the character belongs to. So it is just a good high-level foley with a good sound designer. That is pretty much it.   Do you see audio shows becoming a part of the mainstream? Will we have a new crop of voice actors?   There are already people who are making careers out of voice acting. There are incredibly talented voice-over artists and theatre actors who have a trained and rehearsed voice with grain and texture. So I think the time is already here. And despite the pandemic, there has been an explosion in the audio world.  Is the format a little restricting in terms of genre? For instance, do you see a superhero audio film reaching the audience?  Definitely, I see superhero films adapting to the audio format. There are already detective shows and thrillers, and there’s only space to grow, because it is easy to produce these shows as well. You just need a good sound programmer; you don’t need thousands of crores to depict a very large scene of a battlefield. You can do it with sound alone, and that’s what makes it fun.  How did you prepare to play the role of a sex worker?  I had previously worked on Love Sonia, and during the preparation for that movie, I met a lot of sex workers. I knew of their world before coming on board this show, and that definitely helped.  What do you make of the politics surrounding sex workers in the country?  People don’t fully understand what happens in the lives of sex workers. When people fight for the legalisation of sex work, it does not mean they are fighting to expand the industry. There are multiple instances where young girls are trafficked from their houses, and if you sort of work towards legalisation, these people will have rights.   If you hear my character’s backstory, it is very tragic. I have met sex workers who were trafficked when they were as young as six or seven. If you want to visit hell on earth, you should visit a brothel.   It’s not like the trade is going away... but if we legalise it, then we will have the means to put an end to incidents of trafficking.  What can you tell us about your character in Baby Doll?  My character is a woman with nothing to lose, and she draws her courage from that. The audience should just see how she manages to extract revenge or justice after going through hell. She is someone who doesn’t give up, and is very focused on what she wants.  How is the actor-director relationship when it comes to audio shows?  The actor-director relationship is quite similar to that of conventional movies. The director and writer, Pravesh Bhardwaj, was looking at me from the other room of the dubbing studio and was giving me cues. You know, in some old movies you see people directing the artist in a dubbing studio through a glass screen? It was very similar to that!  Do you see yourself doing more audio shows in the future?  I hope so, as they are very rewarding. I come across people’s experiences listening to these in the fan mail, and it’s really gratifying. I really think there is a world out here that is waiting to be explored.  Would you like to talk about your future projects? A lot of work has come my way. So I am analysing what is better for me; work that will be creatively satisfying. Speaking specifically, there is Fukrey’s third instalment, the second season Great Indian Murder in which we finally solve the case, and at least three films I need to finish between September and December. So, yeah, a lot from my side!",Entertainment

47,‘Tagore remains a tree sheltering people in tough times’,"Bishwanath Ghosh Kolkata  Nature — celebrated in its various forms and moods by Rabindranath Tagore — decided to assert itself with pre-cyclonic rains in Bengal as it celebrated the poet’s birthday, which falls on the 25th day of the month of Baisakh and therefore, usually varies from the English date of May 7.  People from both West Bengal and Bangladesh, poetic in their tribute to modern India’s tallest literary figure on his 161st birth anniversary, asserted that Tagore remained the large banyan tree under which almost every Bengali-speaking person sought either joy or shelter. The general consensus — as numerous celebrations took place in this part of the sub-continent — was that his thoughts and his works, far from being outdated, were even more relevant today.  “Our Tagore eats popcorn. He watches Netflix. He is today and tomorrow. As we hear a symphony in Berlin, strains of his Bipulo tarango re sail through. As we see Satyajit Ray’s Apu walking, Ami chanchal hey automatically plays in the back of our minds. As we read Harry Potter, we find him sitting beside us. He is an elderly friend, guiding us through good times and bad times,” the musician-duo of Sourendro-Soumyojit, highly popular for their three-part album Tagore and We, told The Hindu.  Acutely relevant  Writer Parimal Bhattacharya, who today finds Tagore’s pronouncements on nationalism, civilisation, education and environment growing more acutely relevant, discovered the poet rather late in life. “I grew up in a typical bhadralok family. There was the mandatory 27-volume collected works of Tagore, and his picture on the drawing-room wall. Familiarity breeds indifference, and in my early youth I was attracted to Bengali writers like Buddhadeva Bose and Sunil Gangopadhyay, who were vocal critics of Tagore. I discovered the best of Tagore rather late and it was overwhelming,” said Mr. Bhattacharya.  On the other hand, what influenced cancer researcher-turned-comic artist Argha Manna was not Tagore’s poetry but his art.  “Tagore as a painter intrigued and fascinated me more. To me, he was the best contemporary artist in India, ahead of his time. His art somehow reminds me of art from the pre-Second World War Weimer Republic, Germany. Among different art movements throughout the course of history, the German Expressionism movement makes the deepest impact on me. Tagore’s art resembles the expressionist artist’s work. Not subject-wise or skill-wise, but philosophy-wise. His artworks are examples of raw expression of brain-eye-hand coordination,” Mr. Manna said.  Ahead of time; timeless — these are tributes that came from across the border in Bangladesh as well. While Dhaka-based photographer Jannatul Mawa said that Tagore propagated eco-friendliness long before the world began to discover eco-friendly ways of living; educationist Hena Sultana, associated with the Narayanganj-based Kumudini Welfare Trust, called him a time-conquering tree that sheltered people during sudden rains.  Ms. Mawa said: “His songs offer solutions to life’s problems — they serve as a manual for life. His words made it easier for me to cope with the pandemic.”  Kolkata-based singer Ratna Basu specialises in Sufi songs and doesn’t sing Rabindra Sangeet, but it is Tagore’s words that see her through difficult times. “He is the ultimate refuge,” Ms. Basu said.",Entertainment
