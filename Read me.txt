flask run
------------
database.py makes dataframe from the input articles (or) updates the existing database of articles by inserting the articles
files.py makes text files from the dataframe and divides them to folders based on topics ; NOTE : these adress must exist, code is not written to automatically create them ["datasets/", "datasets/Business", "datasets/Sports", "datasets/Entertainment", "datasets/Tech", "datasets/Politics"]
makecsv.py makes csv from dataframe from which we will later extract the data ; make sure to make ["CSVs/"]
newsclass.py makes multiple csvs based on categories from which we will extract data later ; make sure to make ["CSVs/"]
train.py trains your database and will tell you how accurate is your model

##Note; (If you run this flask main.py) then you do not have to run other files; everything will update automatically except train (which will tell you the accuracy of model)
